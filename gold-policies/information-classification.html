<h3>4.2 Data Handling Controls</h3>
<p>All information at {{organization.name}} is subject to proper handling standards documented in Data Handling Controls. This document provides instructions on how to manage low/med/high items (also known as public/sensitive/confidential) information and can be applied unviersally to documents, communications, secrets, systems, assets, devices, etc.&nbsp; Data Handling Controls are referenced by other policies as-needed and provide the backbone for information management.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>4.3 Asset Classification</h3>

<h3>4.3.1 Information Classification</h3>
<p>Information in a ‘final’ or published state that is either in the custody of or produced and owned by {{organization.name}} must be classified into one of the following three categories:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Public — Information that is not confidential and can be made public without any implications for the organization. Such information is available to the public, employees, consultants and contractors without any authorization.</li>
  <li>Internal — information that is available to employees and authorized non-employees (consultants and contractors) possessing a need to know for business-related purposes.</li>
  <li>Confidential — information that is sensitive within {{organization.name}} and is intended for use only by specified groups of employees. A breach of such information could cause serious embarrassment and possibly undermine public trust in the organization.</li>
</ul>
<p>In some of the circumstances, the confidential information might have to be disclosed to outsiders such as statutory auditors, external consultants, regulatory &amp; legislative bodies etc. The asset owner shall use his discretion with responsibility in getting NDAs signed from such outsiders. Even after such disclosure, the classification still remains ‘confidential’ and does not become ‘public’.</p>
<h3>4.4 Asset Labelling and Handling</h3>
<p>The information and its related assets shall be classified and clearly labelled so that all users are aware of the ownership and classification of the information.</p>
<p>Any information which is not explicitly classified will be classified as “Confidential”, by default to avoid data leakage.</p>
<p>Information and its related IT assets shall be processed and stored strictly in accordance with the classification levels assigned to those assets. All information assets must be secured to meet the requirements of their respective classification levels.</p>
<p>Access to the information assets shall be the responsibility of a designated owner or custodian. All information classified as Internal or Confidential must have security controls applied which are sufficient to ensure that the information is accessible only to those users who are authorized for access.</p>
<p>Any information, which needs to be disclosed or published outside {{organization.name}} – to the media, press etc. shall be done explicitly by or through corporate communications and based on authorization.</p>
