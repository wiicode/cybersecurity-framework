<h1 style="text-align:center;"><strong>{{organization.name}} Server Security Policy</strong></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>1.0 Purpose&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>The purpose of this policy is to establish standards for the base configuration of internal server equipment that is owned and/or operated by {{organization.name}}. Effective implementation of this policy will minimize unauthorized access to {{organization.name}} proprietary information and technology.</p>
<h2>2.0 Scope</h2>
<p>This policy applies to server equipment owned and/or operated by {{organization.name}}, and to servers registered under any {{organization.name}}-owned internal network domain.</p>
<p>Based on the type of servers, such as Cloud Managed Systems, Cloud Managed Instances or Physical Servers, the policy for handling patching, configuration, backups and monitoring shall vary. See the table below.</p>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>3.0 Definitions&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Demilitarized Zone (DMZ):</strong> A network segment external to the corporate production network. Server for purposes of this policy is defined as an internal {{organization.name}} Server. Desktop machines and Lab equipment are not relevant to the scope of this policy.</p>
<p><strong>Intrusion Detection System (IDS):</strong> A system that monitors network traffic for malicious activity.</p>
<p><strong>Intrusion Prevention System (IPS):</strong> A network security prevention technology that examines network traffic flow to detect and prevent vulnerability exploits.</p>
<p><strong>SSH (Secure Shell): </strong>SSH is a network protocol that allows data to be exchanged using a secure channel between two networked devices.</p>
<p><strong>IPSec (Internet Protocol Security):</strong> IPSec is a suite of protocols for securing IP communications by authenticating and encrypting each IP packet of a data stream.</p>
<h2><strong>4.0 Policy&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>4.1 Ownership and Responsibilities&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>All servers deployed at {{organization.name}} must be the responsibility of corporate IT. Approved server configuration guides must be established and maintained by each operational group, based on business needs and approved by {{organization.name}} IT. Operational groups should monitor configuration compliance and implement an exception policy tailored to their environment. Each operational group must establish a process for changing the configuration guides, which includes review and approval by {{organization.name}} IT.</p>
<p>Servers must be registered within the corporate enterprise management system. At a minimum, the following information is required to positively identify the point of contact:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Server contact(s) and location, and a backup requirements.</li>
  <li>Hardware and Operating System/Version</li>
  <li>Main functions and applications, if applicable</li>
  <li>Information in the corporate enterprise management system must be kept up-to-date</li>
  <li>Configuration changes for production servers must follow the appropriate change management procedures</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Policy Conditions:</i></p>
<ul>
  <li>Physical security and maintenance of the infrastructure (hardware, software, networking, and facilities that run the Cloud services) is the responsibility of the Provider in the case of Cloud Managed Systems and Cloud Managed Instances.</li>
  <li>Physical security and maintenance of the infrastructure (hardware, software, networking, and facilities that run the server) is the responsibility of {{organization.name}} in the case of Physical servers being used.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4.2 General Configuration and Backup Guidelines&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Operating System configuration should be in accordance with approved {{organization.name}} IT guidelines. Services and applications that will not be used must be disabled where practical.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>All production server instances should exist solely in Amazon Web Services VPC under EC2, Elastic Beanstalk, or Elastic Container Services.</li>
  <li>Access to services should be logged and/or protected through access-control methods, if possible.</li>
  <li>The most recent security patches must be installed on the system as soon as practical, the only exception being when the immediate application would interfere with business requirements.</li>
  <li>Always use standard security principles of least required access to perform a function. Do not use root when a non-privileged account is acceptable.</li>
  <li>If a methodology for secure channel connection is available (i.e., technically feasible), privileged access must be performed over secure channels, (e.g., encrypted network connections using SSH or IPSec).</li>
  <li>The production servers shall be backed up according to stated business requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Policy Conditions:</i></p>
<ul>
  <li>Configurations and backups for Cloud Managed Systems shall be managed by the provider.</li>
  <li>Configurations and backups for Cloud Managed Instances and Physical Servers shall be managed by {{organization.name}} in accordance with the Server Security Policy.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>4.3 Monitoring</strong></h3>
<p>All security-related events on critical or sensitive systems must be logged and audit trails saved as follows:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Logs are accessible only to appropriate applications and trusted users (via sudo or similar access control).</li>
  <li>A review of logs will only be done with read-only access tools (e.g., view, more, less, graphical web tools for accessing/filtering logs, etc.).</li>
  <li>All security related logs will be kept online for a minimum of 1 week.</li>
  <li>Security-related events will be reported to {{organization.name}} IT, who will review logs and report incidents to IT management. Corrective measures will be prescribed as needed. Security-related events include, but are not limited to:&nbsp;<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Evidence of targeted attacks against specific systems</li>
      <li>Evidence of unauthorized access to privileged accounts</li>
      <li>Anomalous occurrences that are not related to specific applications on the host</li>
      <li>Loss or breach of sensitive data</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The server shall also be monitored for capacity and performance requirements. The incident management process shall be followed for confirmed events and anomalies.</li>
  <li>Forecast future processing demand of system components on an ongoing basis and compare with schedule capacity. In addition, forecasts shall be reviewed and approved by IT management. Change requests must be initiated as needed based on approved forecasts.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Policy Conditions:</i></p>
<ul>
  <li>Logging and monitoring for SaaS shall be managed by the provider.</li>
  <li>Logging and monitoring for CaaS and Physical Servers shall be managed by {{organization.name}} in accordance with the Server Security Policy.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>4.4 Patch Management&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>All servers under {{organization.name}} will be maintained with the latest security patches to their operating systems and key applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Patching to Windows instances is done automatically and granted automatic approval.&nbsp; All Windows systems are subjected to ongoing installation of operating system patches unless explicitly exempted.&nbsp; Periodic reports are reviewed for complaince.&nbsp; Patching to Linux instances is done using scheduled tasks configured to the unique needs of each system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All high/critical patches must be applied as soon as practically possible, but not longer than thirty (30) calendar days after public release for any critical production server.&nbsp; All patches that are medium/high severity or for non-critical systems must be rolled out within ninety (90) calendar days.&nbsp; Any low priority patches will be installed on a case-by-case basis.&nbsp; All patches should be tested on development systems before being rolled out to production, where possible.</p>
<p>In case the patches cannot follow the aforementioned schedule, a document must be produced explaining why the patch must be deferred. Permissible deferrals may include a lack of appropriate change windows within the appropriate timeframe or a conflict with other critical changes scheduled at that time. Approvals shall be granted by Director of IT.</p>
<p><i>Policy Conditions:</i></p>
<ul>
  <li>Patch Management for SaaS shall be managed by the provider.</li>
  <li>Patch Management for CaaS and Physical Servers shall be managed by {{organization.name}} in accordance with the Server Security Policy.</li>

<p>Every effort will be made to prevent audits from causing operational failures or disruptions.&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Policy Conditions:</i></p>
<ul>
  <li>Applicable to SaaS and CaaS.</li>
