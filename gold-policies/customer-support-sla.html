<h1><strong>4.0 Service Management</strong></h1>
<p>Effective support of in-scope services is a result of maintaining consistent service levels. The following sections provide relevant details on service availability, monitoring of in-scope services and related components.</p>
<h3><strong>4.1 Service Availability</strong></h3>
<p>Coverage parameters specific to the service(s) are customer business hours unless superseded by additional agreements. Support requests received outside of office hours will be collected, however no action can be guaranteed until the next working day.</p>
<h3><strong>4.2 Service Requests</strong></h3>
<p>Bento Holdings, Inc. would provide ongoing support to customers using the approved service support channel and knowledge base resources. The time available is determined by the Request Priority and the SLA Policy for defined for each customer.</p>
<h4>Request Priority</h4>
<p>Bento Holdings, Inc. assigns a priority to each ticket when it is received.&nbsp; As per section 3.2, it is the customer’s responsibility to request a change to this priority if they feel that a different priority level is required. For reference the following is a guide to how priority is determined:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Urgent</strong>: Critical production issue affecting all users, including system unavailability and data integrity issues with no workaround available.</li>
  <li><strong>High</strong>: Major functionality is impacted or performance is significantly degraded. Issue is persistent and affects many users. No reasonable workaround is available.</li>
  <li><strong>Normal</strong>: Intermittent system performance issue or bug impacting some workflows or users but not consistently. Short-term workaround is available, but not scalable.</li>
  <li><strong>Low</strong>: Inquiry regarding a routine technical issue; information requested on application, capabilities, navigation, installation or configuration; bug affecting a small number of users.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Default Priority</h4>
<p>By default, customers can expect that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Actual or suspected security incidents are treated as urgent and are subject to after-hours/extended billing.</li>
  <li>All other requests are considered “Low” unless otherwise stated by the submitter or determined during validation.</li>
</ul>
<h4>SLA Policy</h4>
<p>For all support agreements Bento Holdings, Inc. uses Best Effort (BE) to respond during the stated response window. Details for each support agreement are disclosed at <a href="https://www.techbento.com/sla/">https://www.techbento.com/sla/</a> and subject to change without notice if adapt to changing security, technology or service delivery needs.</p>
<p>For user requests, the goal of each response is to assist the user in solving the problem themselves. For security incidents, the goal of each response is to swiftly validate/contain/remediate the problem. For alarms/notifications, the goal is to solve the issue on behalf of the customer.</p>
<p>For reference, the table below describes the intent and expectations of each agreement.</p>

<h4><strong>SLA Exclusions</strong></h4>
<p>After a report has been logged, Bento Holdings, Inc. responds in compliance with the relevant Service Level, unless the Customer does not comply with its obligations; or has engaged Bento Holdings, Inc. to make material changes to infrastructure or services.</p>
<h3><strong>4.4 Cyber Incident Response&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Events</strong>&nbsp;are when something happens that is (most of the time) unusual, whether planned or unplanned.&nbsp;<strong>Incidents</strong>, on the other hand, are when something happens and it interrupts something else.&nbsp;<strong>Events and Incidents</strong>&nbsp;are not mutually exclusive. All&nbsp;<strong>incidents</strong>&nbsp;are&nbsp;<strong>events</strong>&nbsp;but not all&nbsp;<strong>events</strong>&nbsp;are&nbsp;<strong>incidents</strong>.&nbsp; Customers are able to attribute priority to all events, but a<i>dditional resources are attributed</i> to prioritized <strong>incidents</strong>.</p>
<p>The Bento Holdings Cyber Incident Response (CIR) policy for considers any <strong>incident</strong> with <i><strong>material significance</strong></i> as <strong>High</strong> priority. Bento Holdings offers each customer the ability to incorporate relevant portions of their <i>Incident Response Plan (IRP)</i> into the scope of provided services.&nbsp; In areas where there is a gap or lack of an IRP, the Bento Holdings Default Cyber Incident Response policy is applied.</p>
<h4>Materially Significant Impact</h4>
<p>We use our judgement to help protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information systems and data.&nbsp; Materially Significant Impact is determined by Bento Holdings by the following process:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Defined</strong> scope in customer’s letter of agreement or operational documents.</li>
  <li><strong>Requested</strong> by the customer as part of the report.</li>
  <li><strong>Perceived</strong> effects on confidentiality, availability, or integrity of customer data.</li>
  <li><strong>Reported</strong> details suggest the need for escalation or <strong>lack of detail – </strong>presence of <i>ambiguity – </i>which prompts immediate validation.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Default Response</h4>
<p>Bento Holdings will prioritize <i>events </i>suspected of materially significant impact.&nbsp; Unless explicitly defined in customer’s letter of agreement, Bento Holdings will temporarily raise the Service Level Agreement for a customer (Bronze, Silver and Gold), on an incident basis, to the next-tier.&nbsp;&nbsp;Customers receive priority outside of an established agreement, charged at a premium and require customer communication through completion<i><strong>.</strong></i></p>
<p>Bento Holdings will do the following actions in these cases:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Validate</strong>&nbsp;this alert and determine whether an incident took place.</li>
  <li><strong>Determine</strong> the <strong>scope</strong>&nbsp;of the incident and risks to your organization.</li>
  <li>Take<strong> measures we deem necessary to</strong> <strong>protect</strong> your systems.&nbsp; This may advance the request to a point of containment or through complete resolution.</li>
  <li><strong>Notify</strong> you of the <strong>impacts and risks</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Work</strong> with you to determine the next steps to wholly <strong>resolve</strong> the incident.</li>
  <li><strong>Debrief</strong> this incident if requested.</li>
</ol>
<p>Customer responsibility during this time is as follows<strong>:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Follow&nbsp;<strong>Customer Requirements&nbsp;</strong>when reporting issues.</li>
  <li>Supply background/contextual information</li>
  <li>Provide a contact instructions and respond to all messages/calls.</li>
  <li>Be prepared to immediately answer all questions promptly and name any CCs that should be added to this request.</li>
  <li>Follow all instructions.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Billing</strong></p>
<p><strong>CIR</strong> events are billed at a higher rate, billed in increments, and require customer communicate the closure (or hold) of a request to release our team and stop billing. Billing for <strong>CIR</strong> events starts when event validation commences. Billing continues until the event is <i><strong>contained</strong></i> or <i><strong>resolved</strong></i>. Customers may request that work is stopped/paused at any time via the request system.</p>
