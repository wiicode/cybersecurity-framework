# The Tale of the Nigerian Prince.

Nearly every inbox in the world has seen a plea from the “Nigerian Prince”, or some servant of the far-away court. In each case, the plea asks for help from a recipient: in exchange for bank account information and a portion of fees, the “Nigerian Prince” will send many dollars to the recipient’s account in an effort to move the money out of their country.

The reaction from most people is to scoff an the absurdity of this obvious scam and delete the message. Few ever ask themselves why is it so prolific and why would anyone spend time talking about it?  The answer is simple: most people is not all people. This type of scam can hit your organization and there is little you can do to stop it. The “scoffers” also scoff at that assessment.

This scam is typically targeting larger corporations, and it paints a depressing portrait of how weak business defenses can be, when most business owners won’t even take it seriously.

The fact is, this scam - like many others - is big business. According to the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) 2015 Annual Report there has been $1,070,711,522 in reported losses in the United states with a average dollar loss of $3,718. The “Nigerian Prince” managed to get some of that money.

The “Nigerian Prince” email itself is, in reality, a cog in a greater extortion machine. The fundamental reason it persists today is that the act of wiring money to an account, in order for it to go to another, is money laundering. Although the intent is to move money from one country to another, typically it is money leaving the U.S. and not the other way around.

The intended targets of the money laundering cog are typically people with good intentions and difficult circumstances. They are generally vulnerable on multiple fronts including financial insecurity, love, or physical mobility. They will become convinced, over time, that the person on the other side is real and needs their help. In the process of helping, they may help themselves. The help is exactly as prescribed - transfer money.

There are many vulnerable people with access to bank accounts, valuable data, or even the purse strings of a business. While scammers seek them out and establish relationships, they also target companies. By this point, you probably recognize that the money is not coming from the proverbial Nigeria. Instead, it is coming out of people and organizations that have more to lose.

While the first half of the scam focuses on emotional and circumstantial vulnerabilities of people, the other half exploits impulsivity and privilege. As the money laundering cogs are assembled, so are the real victims of this two part-scam.

Scammers collect information on organizations from a variety of sources including corporate websites, databases, and leaked data. With minimal effort, they have profiles and dossiers on corporations and can rank the degree of difficulty required to extract money.

The targeting happens en-masse, at many companies simultaneously, with the expectation that some will fall victim. Generally, a form of impersonation is used to make requests or access bank account information. The effort the scammers will make will be proportional to the perceived value of the business. In some cases they will go to great lengths to impersonate individuals while others it will be a sloppy series of emails hoping for a few bucks.

While the efforts may vary between organizations and over time, the result is the same. A person out-right transfers money or installs software on a computer giving the scammers remote control of the systems. Bear in mind, all malware is software but all software is not malware. Remote control software is commonly used for support and management practices, and will not be seen as a threat by anti-malware. In many cases, they will study the patterns and business practices and eventually strike at making a withdrawal.

This is where scam goes full circle. The money is sent towards the laundering cog. That person, for reasons too many to state, nearly always forwards it to another account via wire-transfer. Soon enough, that money is outside of the country.

With the volume of scams, the FBI requires a level of loss - once at $100,000 and now at $1million to effectively take action. Police departments are often unwilling to take jurisdiction, as often the jurisdiction over such matters is unclear anyways. The result is a clean get-away while the money laundering cog received validation that their “relationship” is real, and will continue to provide transfer services over multiple transactions.

## Lesson: Business Email Compromise.

Business email compromise is defined as a sophisticated scam targeting businesses working with foreign suppliers and/or businesses that regularly perform wire transfer payments. The scam is carried out by compromising legitimate business email accounts through social engineering or computer intrusion techniques to conduct unauthorized transfers of funds.

The IC3 began receiving complaints describing BEC scams in 2010. Victims at the time identified themselves as United States–based businesses which had long-term working relationships with Asian suppliers. Victims were instructed through spoofed emails, intercepted facsimiles, or telephone communications to redirect invoice remittance payments. Fraudulent transfers have gone through accounts in many countries, with a large majority traveling through Asia. The scam began to evolve in 2013 when victims indicated the email accounts of Chief Executive Officers or Chief Financial Officers of targeted businesses were hacked or spoofed, and wire payments were requested to be sent to fraudulent locations. BEC continued to evolve, and in 2014, victim businesses reported having personal emails compromised and multiple fraudulent requests for payment sent to vendors identified from their contact list. In 2015, victims reported being contacted by subjects posing as lawyers or law firms instructing them to make secret or time sensitive wire transfers.

BEC is linked to other types of criminal activity including romance, lottery, employment, and check scams. Victims of these scams may be used to unknowingly transfer fraudulent funds on behalf of the perpetrators. In 2015, the IC3 received 7,838 BEC complaints with losses of over $263 million.
