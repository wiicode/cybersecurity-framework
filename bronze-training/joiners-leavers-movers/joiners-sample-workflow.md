In this example we use a Wiki system (such as BENTO:GUIDES) to store a checklist which a manager updates for a new hire, an operatons administrator completes, and then the list is cross-checked with access control settings.  Lastly, all involved parties sign-off on their work. Collectively, this page becomes a "Statement of Record" and meets most compliance requirements today.

In general, BCSF recommends that small organizations using manual onboarding process consider:
- A Wiki based document for managing the initial employee information such as software/hardware needs and wants.
- A database (or spreadsheet) system for storing employee information and product assinment including hardware and software licenses. This, better known as asset tracking, should be be designed to enable easy financial reporting. Costs often serve as a reliable control tool for small company ACL management.
- A training platform where users can view and acknowledge training has taken place.
