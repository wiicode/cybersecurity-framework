<p>Cyber skills are already in high demand, and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/news/450420193/Europe-faces-shortage-of-350000-cyber-security-professionals-by-2022">Global Information Security Workforce study</a>&nbsp;estimates that by 2022 there will a shortfall of 350,000 appropriately trained and experienced individuals&nbsp;in Europe.&nbsp; Organisations must take steps now to&nbsp;ensure&nbsp;they can draw on cyber security expertise in the future.&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<h2>What should the board do?</h2>
<h3><strong>Baseline your current skills</strong></h3>
<p>The Board&nbsp;should have an understanding of what cyber expertise there is in the&nbsp;organisation and what you need. Do you have a CISO? An information security team? Incident managers? If not, should you?</p>
<p>This information will give you an insight into the resilience of cyber security efforts (are you currently reliant on one person?) and also will help you to understand the provenance of the cyber security information you receive.</p>
<p>You might also want to consider the expertise on the Board itself. Do you currently have sufficient specialist knowledge to ensure that the Board is able to make appropriate strategic decisions about cyber security? Are you likely to be able to keep pace as advances in technology bring new security challenges?</p>
<hr>
<h2>What should your organisation do?</h2>
<h3><strong>Make an organisational plan</strong></h3>
<p>Given the lack of suitably skilled individuals and an increasing reliance on digital services that need to be secured, organisations that do not embrace cyber security will soon fall behind.</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Work out&nbsp;what specific cyber security expertise&nbsp;you need.</strong>&nbsp;'Cyber security' covers a range of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cybok.org/media/downloads/CyBOK_clusters_-_Final.jpg">different&nbsp;skills</a>, from network security to risk management to incident response.&nbsp;It may be useful to first consider what skills you need to manage&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/board-toolkit?curPage=/collection/board-toolkit/establishing-baseline-identifying-care-about-most">your highest priority objectives or risks</a>&nbsp;and then assess which (if any) of these you cannot outsource and so must have in house.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>Establish&nbsp;how urgently you need these skills.</strong>&nbsp;If you are considering developing existing staff, don't underestimate what this entails.&nbsp;Putting someone through a training course does <strong>not</strong> make them a cyber security expert: they must also have the opportunity to develop hands-on, practical skills and so will require support for this from within the organisation.&nbsp;If you need expertise in the shorter-term, it might be better to recruit a&nbsp;consultant or specialist.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Consider how you might recognise professional cyber security skills.</strong>&nbsp;As yet, there is no professional body for cyber security expertise (although the NCSC is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/developing-cyber-security-profession-have-your-say">working on it</a>).&nbsp;This could mean that validating the ability or quality of a new hire and/or developing training plans, is difficult. Consider how you might be able to work with trusted partners or industry specialists to give you the necessary assurance.&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>MAKE THE BEST USE OF THE SKILLS YOU HAVE</strong></h5>
<p>The best way to make use of the skills you have is to identify and focus on the things that are unique to you (or the things that only people within your organisation are most qualified to do). This can be enabled by making use of established, commodity technologies. For example you might choose to allow cloud vendors to build and secure your infrastructure, which frees your experts to spend time exploiting the unique insight they have into your organistion.</p>
<h3><strong>Build your best workforce: equal, diverse and inclusive</strong></h3>
<p>Due to the cyber security skills shortfall, your organisation must draw and nurture talent from the largest possible pool. The cyber security industry is subject to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/diversity-technology-challenge-ncsc">the same skills challenges as all technology-focused industries</a>. Organisations may find it hard to recruit and retain high-calibre staff from all demographic groups. In fact there are many&nbsp;talented women and minorities&nbsp;working in cyber security, but they are often less visible. They may experience hostile working environments that slow or stop their career, or avoid the industry altogether. Working together to overcome these challenges will give your organisation a competitive edge.</p>
<h5><strong>LOOK BEYOND TECHNICAL SKILLS</strong></h5>
<p>When designing job roles and desired candidate profiles, particularly at entry level, be imaginative. Protecting our organisations relies on bringing together many different skills, technical and non-technical, to deliver security that aligns with the organisation's&nbsp;objectives.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/what-kinds-people-do-we-need-doing-cyber-security">Recruit for broader business skills</a>,&nbsp;aspiration and potential as much as for current technical skills.</p>
<h5><strong>LOOK AFTER YOUR EXISTING TALENT</strong></h5>
<p>When trying to make our organisations more diverse and inclusive, we often focus on bringing in&nbsp;<strong>new</strong>&nbsp;talent, while ignoring the issues that prevent your&nbsp;<strong>current</strong>&nbsp;staff staying and thriving once they are in. The talent available may be beyond your own direct control, but you&nbsp;<strong>can&nbsp;</strong>control how much cyber security talent you lose because of&nbsp;difficult policies and processes, and unwelcoming&nbsp;workplace cultures. As much as strong&nbsp;<i>security</i>&nbsp;cultures, you should focus on fully&nbsp;<i>inclusive</i>&nbsp;workplace cultures.</p>
<h3><strong>Train, buy-in, or&nbsp;develop for the future</strong></h3>
<p>Broadly there are 3 options to increase cyber expertise within your organisation.</p>
<h5><strong>TRAIN EXISTING STAFF</strong></h5>
<p>Don't just consider the staff who are already in security-related jobs. The&nbsp;NCSC has had huge success training staff from a variety of backgrounds, skills and experience.&nbsp;After all, there are many different aspects to cyber security and someone who is expert at designing a network architecture might have a very different skill set to the person working with staff to make sure security policies are practical and effective.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Depending on your organisation's needs and your staff, training could take the form of on-the-job training, professional qualifications or placements. Do remember that developing cyber security expertise is no different to many other professional areas: staff will require continuous investment, training and development opportunities to hone their expertise and also to keep up with changes in the industry.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>There are many companies who offer cyber security training. NCSC provides a list of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/information/gchq-certified-training">accredited training courses</a>.</li>
  <li>You could also offer time for study on an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/information/ncsc-certified-degrees">NCSC certified degree</a>, or time for a placement on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/information/industry-100">Industry100</a>&nbsp;programme.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>BUY IN EXPERTISE</strong></h5>
<p>There are several complementary routes available for introducing external expertise. A large organisation will probably take advantage of all of them.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Recruit a skilled non-executive director to your Board.</li>
  <li>Employ a consultant to provide specific cyber security advice.</li>
  <li>Identify specific cyber security services which can be fulfilled by a 3rd party.</li>
  <li>Recruit employees who already have the skills you need.</li>
</ol>
<p>Recruiting expertise externally can provide a quick solution where there's a lack of specialised cyber security knowledge. However, be sure to identify someone who can adapt cyber security principles to&nbsp;<strong>your</strong>&nbsp;organisation.&nbsp; 'One size fits all' is rarely applicable in terms of cyber security, and someone who just applies an out-of-the-box solution may not be significantly improving your cyber resilience.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>A good place to look for external expertise is NCSC's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/information/about-certified-professional-scheme">certified cyber professionals</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Develop future staff: sponsorship, apprenticeships and work experience</strong></h4>
<p>Supporting young people to pursue an education in cyber security can be a brilliant way of ensuring a future&nbsp;pipeline&nbsp;of employees with the right skills. There are many schemes aimed at school and university-age students and almost all of them involve some industry participation or support, including apprenticeships, site visits and speaker opportunities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NCSC runs&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cyberfirst.ncsc.gov.uk/">CyberFirst</a>&nbsp;events and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/fresh-drive-develop-next-generation-cyber-security-experts">apprenticeships&nbsp;</a>and is looking for company sponsors and placements. You could also forge links with universities through involvement in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/information/cyber-invest">CyberInvest&nbsp;</a>scheme which enables organisations to fund and support cyber security research.</p>

<h2>What does good look like?</h2>
<p>The following questions can be used to generate productive discussions with your technical team. The aim is to identify what constitutes 'good' cyber security in terms of growing cyber security expertise.</p>
<h3><strong>Q1. As an organisation, what cyber expertise do we need, and what do we have?</strong></h3>
<p>You should find out:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What expertise do we need to manage our cyber risk? What do we need to keep&nbsp;in-house and what can we outsource?</li>
  <li>Are each of our requirements continuous? For example, you might only need a penetration testing team to come in&nbsp;a few times&nbsp;a year, but you might need someone to&nbsp;monitor your systems&nbsp;all year round.</li>
  <li>What expertise is the minimum for&nbsp;all staff? How can you ensure a healthy cyber security culture in the organisation? How well and how frequently are you training staff in your security policies and any particular threats your organisation might be vulnerable to?&nbsp;</li>
  <li>How many staff do we currently have with cyber security expertise and what gaps are they telling us we have in our provision?</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Q2. As an organisation, what is our plan to develop what we don't have?</strong></h3>
<p>You should find out:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Which skills are a priority?</li>
  <li>Who owns the plan to develop cyber expertise, and how are they responsible for delivering against it?</li>
  <li>How you will find people with the right aptitude for the different cyber security skills? Remember that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/origin-stories">people from all backgrounds</a>, and with technical and non-technical skills, may be well suited to this field.</li>
  <li>What support the Board can give to this work, both in terms of investment or broader resources?</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Q3. As a Board member, do I have the right level of expertise to be accountable for cyber security decisions?</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Do I understand enough about the decisions being made on cyber security in my organisation to be accountable to shareholders?</li>
  <li>If not, what plan do I have in place to increase my expertise? The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/board-tooltkit/introduction-cyber-security-board-members">Introduction to Cyber Security</a>&nbsp;section of this Toolkit is a good place to start. There are also many training providers who run sessions specifically for Board&nbsp;level.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Q4. As an organisation, are we building an equal, diverse and inclusive workforce to tackle our cyber security skills challenges?</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Do we have a champion for EDI (Equality, Diversity and Inclusion)?</li>
  <li>Do we have the right policies in place, and do they work well in practice as well as looking good on paper?</li>
  <li>Are we gathering the right data and interpreting it correctly? Are we then having the right conversations with individuals all around the organisation, to supplement this data and create a richer picture on less tangible measures?</li>
  <li>Are we making active, meaningful efforts to recruit from all communities, to reflect the society we operate in?</li>
  <li>Do we use a range of recruitment methods, to help overcome unconscious bias and ensure we fully explore candidate strengths?</li>
  <li>Are we confident that we are recruiting and developing staff to meet the challenges our organisation will face in the future, not just complete the tasks of today?</li>
  <li>Are we creating the right environment and culture to make staff feel confident, safe and comfortable in flagging issues?</li>
</ul>
