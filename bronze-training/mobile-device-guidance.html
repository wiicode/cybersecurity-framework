<p>Securing mobile devices is an essential part of guarding your organisation against a variety of threats, many of which herald from the internet.</p>
<p>Mobile devices come in many different shapes and sizes: smartphones, tablets, laptops and even desktop PCs. When thinking about how to secure these devices,&nbsp;a number of questions come to mind, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Which devices should I buy?</li>
  <li>How should I configure these devices?</li>
  <li>What security software should I load onto them?</li>
</ul>
<p>The NCSC has answered these questions, and more. These pages form a comprehensive guide to the protection of mobile devices.</p>
<h3><strong>Structure of the Mobile Device Guidance</strong></h3>
<p>Taken as a whole, our&nbsp;<i>Mobile Device Guidance&nbsp;</i>covers the full range of concerns, from choosing and purchasing devices, right through to advising end users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each of these questions has it's own page, so you can easily find the advice you need for a particular problem. The questions have been arranged under four headings, representing the major areas of concern:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/mobile-device-guidance/getting-ready">Getting ready</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/mobile-device-guidance/policies-and-settings">Policies and settings</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/mobile-device-guidance/managing-deployed-devices">Managing deployed devices</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/mobile-device-guidance/infrastructure">Infrastructure</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Devices and platforms</strong></p>
<p>We also have&nbsp;specific guides for the most common device types&nbsp;being used in the UK today: Android, Chrome, <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/mobile-device-guidance/platform-guides/ios-and-ipados">iOS (including iPadOS)</a>, <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/mobile-device-guidance/platform-guides/macos">macOS</a>, Ubuntu and Windows.</p>
<h3><strong>Audience</strong></h3>
<p>These guides are aimed primarily at business users, with a focus on those deploying or managing large IT estates. However, the advice holds good for all users, and all operating systems. So if you only have a few devices to look after this guidance can still be very useful.</p>
<p>For individuals, we suggest taking a look at our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/section/information-for/individuals-families">Cyber security advice for individuals and families</a>, which includes specific guidance about how to look after your personal smartphones, tablets and PCs.</p>
<h3><strong>Case studies</strong></h3>
<p>If you're looking for some ideas on how to make small, tangible improvements in your network security, the NCSC has worked with several organisations across the UK to deploy mobile devices securely.</p>
<p>We have jointly published&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/information/case-studies--the-secure-by-default-partnership-programme">several case studies</a>&nbsp;which might give you some ideas about improvements to make within your own organisation.</p>
