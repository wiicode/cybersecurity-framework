<p>Securing mobile devices is an essential part of guarding your organisation against a variety of threats, many of which herald from the internet.</p>
<p>Mobile devices come in many different shapes and sizes: smartphones, tablets, laptops and even desktop PCs. When thinking about how to secure these devices,&nbsp;a number of questions come to mind, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Which devices should I buy?</li>
  <li>How should I configure these devices?</li>
  <li>What security software should I load onto them?</li>
</ul>
<p>The NCSC has answered these questions, and more. These pages form a comprehensive guide to the protection of mobile devices.</p>
<h3><strong>Structure of the Mobile Device Guidance</strong></h3>
<p>Taken as a whole, our&nbsp;<i>Mobile Device Guidance&nbsp;</i>covers the full range of concerns, from choosing and purchasing devices, right through to advising end users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each of these questions has it's own page, so you can easily find the advice you need for a particular problem. The questions have been arranged under four headings, representing the major areas of concern:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/mobile-device-guidance/getting-ready">Getting ready</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/mobile-device-guidance/policies-and-settings">Policies and settings</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/mobile-device-guidance/managing-deployed-devices">Managing deployed devices</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/mobile-device-guidance/infrastructure">Infrastructure</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Devices and platforms</strong></p>
<p>We also have&nbsp;specific guides for the most common device types&nbsp;being used in the UK today: Android, Chrome, <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/mobile-device-guidance/platform-guides/ios-and-ipados">iOS (including iPadOS)</a>, <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/mobile-device-guidance/platform-guides/macos">macOS</a>, Ubuntu and Windows.</p>
<h3><strong>Audience</strong></h3>
<p>These guides are aimed primarily at business users, with a focus on those deploying or managing large IT estates. However, the advice holds good for all users, and all operating systems. So if you only have a few devices to look after this guidance can still be very useful.</p>
<p>For individuals, we suggest taking a look at our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/section/information-for/individuals-families">Cyber security advice for individuals and families</a>, which includes specific guidance about how to look after your personal smartphones, tablets and PCs.</p>
<h3><strong>Case studies</strong></h3>
<p>If you're looking for some ideas on how to make small, tangible improvements in your network security, the NCSC has worked with several organisations across the UK to deploy mobile devices securely.</p>
<p>We have jointly published&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/information/case-studies--the-secure-by-default-partnership-programme">several case studies</a>&nbsp;which might give you some ideas about improvements to make within your own organisation.</p>

<h1>Policies and settings</h1>

<p>Securely configuring laptops, phones, tablets and PCs</p>
<p>Once you’ve chosen which devices your staff will use and decided how they should use them, you’ll need to start thinking about how to configure these devices and the services on them. Ideally, there will be a combination of settings and controls which makes it easy for your users to get their jobs done but makes it hard for attackers to compromise your systems.</p>
<p>This section talks you through some of the areas you’ll want to think about in detail when developing your policies.</p>
<p>These guides include recommendations for several platforms. But, once you have a set of policies to implement, our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/mobile-device-guidance/platform-guides">platform specific guides</a>&nbsp;will give you greater detail on how to achieve this for the operating system, or systems, you've opted to deploy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Choosing, buying and deploying laptops, phones, tablets and PCs</p>
<p>Before you start deploying and configuring mobile devices, there are a few important decisions you need to make. This includes&nbsp;which devices to buy, how to buy them, and how to get them into the hands of your users, securely.</p>
<p>The choices you make at this stage of your deployment can have a huge impact on the resulting security of your networks, so it’s important to get them right. The guides in this section will walk you through these key decisions, highlighting the security issues at stake and suggesting 'best practice' solutions where possible.</p>
