<p>Security monitoring is central to the identification and detection of threats to your IT systems. It acts as your eyes and ears when detecting and recovering from security incidents and it enables you to ensure that mobile devices are used in accordance with your organisational policies.</p>
<p>Effective monitoring relies on proportionate, reliable logging and device management practices. This guidance is designed to&nbsp;give system and network admins advice on the logging and monitoring options available on mobile platforms.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Why use logging and protective monitoring?</h2>
<p>Many large-scale incidents have been shown to target individual hosts, from which attackers will attempt to further strengthen their access through <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/preventing-lateral-movement">lateral movement techniques</a> such as <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2017/06/27/new-ransomware-old-techniques-petya-adds-worm-capabilities/?source=mmpc">credential theft, account impersonation, use of legitimate network tools</a> or <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2017/05/12/wannacrypt-ransomware-worm-targets-out-of-date-systems/?source=mmpc">known exploits in outdated versions of network protocols</a> to propagate and compromise additional devices to access additional data and services.</p>
<p>Some of these more traditional techniques&nbsp;may not apply in cloud-only or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/mobile-device-guidance/infrastructure/network-architectures-for-remote-access">zero trust network architectures</a>. However, monitoring device activity, health, and configuration arguably become&nbsp;<i>more</i>&nbsp;important when deciding whether to permit access to organisational services and data.</p>
<p>Logging and monitoring will help you to identify patterns of activity on your networks, which in turn provide indicators of compromise. In the event of incidents, logging data can help to more effectively identify the source and the extent of compromise.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Preparation for logging and monitoring</h2>
<p>There are many types of events and signals that you may be able to collect from mobile devices. Monitoring of mobile devices should form part of your organisation's wider approach to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/introduction-logging-security-purposes">logging</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/10-steps-to-cyber-security/the-10-steps/monitoring">monitoring</a>. Very often, successful intrusion detection requires multiple sources of information.</p>
<p>In general terms, monitoring data could come from event-driven logs, such as website connections, or device configurations details, such as the current operating system version running on a device.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a first step, you should seek to understand the types and sources of data you need, and are able to collect. To help with this process, we have broadly classified data sources that may be available in the table below.</p>

          <p>Host-based logging can provide a rich source of data. Typically, this would include events relating to things like the file system, running processes, and program load events. Host based logging can also provide additional event sources such as&nbsp;website connections and device or service logons.</p>
          <p>Some mobile device operating systems will support a rich set of built-in system logs that can be forwarded to a centralised store, while others will provide a very limited set of logs.</p>
          <p>Depending on the mobile device platform, it may be possible to install additional host-based agents to collect log data, above and beyond built-in capabilities. However, this comes with the overhead of requiring additional software to be installed on the device. It also entails extra management requirements for the host-based agent. In some cases, installed agents may even introduce additional threat risks.</p>

This can assist in identifying mobile devices that may have connected to malicious sites by, for example, clicking a phishing link or downloading a malicious file. More advanced features can also include signature or heuristic-based detection techniques.</td>

          <p>An important feature of mobile device management is the monitoring of device status and configuration. This data can be used to assess device compliance against organisational policies. For example, is the device operating system up to date?</p>
          <p>Because there are many mobile devices and a range of <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/mobile-device-guidance/choosing-and-using-mobile-device-management-services">mobile device management</a>&nbsp;systems,&nbsp;the level of support for this kind of compliance data vary widely, as do the actions you can take based on this data.

          <p>Remote device attestation is designed to report a set of trusted signals and measurements for a device and the software running on it. These measurements should be protected and reported in such a way that, even if the device is compromised, the measurements can be relied upon. Stronger forms of attestation will typically combine hardware backed key stores and roots of trust with public key based cryptographic operations for storing and reporting trusted measurements of device state.</p>
          <p>Support for remote device attestation will vary significantly across different mobile devices and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/mobile-device-guidance/choosing-and-using-mobile-device-management-services">mobile device management services</a>.

<p>You should carefully consider your access to, and use of, these data sources. Along with the logging and remote management capabilities of the mobile devices your organisation is using, they will determine your ability to detect and respond to security incidents, or policy breaches.</p>

<h2>How to monitor and log</h2>
<p><strong>Establish a strategy</strong></p>
<p>The NCSC's <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/10-steps-to-cyber-security/the-10-steps/monitoring">10 steps to cyber security</a>&nbsp;will help you implement a strategy for security monitoring. This should be first and foremost based on business need and the assessment of risk to business services and assets.</p>
<p><strong>Implement a logging strategy</strong></p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/introduction-logging-security-purposes">Introduction to logging</a>&nbsp;provides a four-step program to help you devise and implement a suitable logging capability.</p>
<p><strong>What to watch</strong></p>
<p>For mobile devices, you should include monitoring of device state and compliance. You should also log device events, including user activity, network communications,&nbsp; authentication and access, to both devices and services.</p>
<p><strong>Collect and&nbsp;analyse</strong></p>
<p>You should collect and analyse your log data. This will give you the ability to detect and respond to security events. Where possible you should automate detection and remediation.</p>
<p><strong>Evolve your plan</strong></p>
<p>Your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/incident-management">incident management plans and policies</a>&nbsp;should include the ability to learn from security incidents. These lessons may suggest ways in which you can improve your monitoring set up. For example, a particular type of data may have been missing, or the duration of your log storage may be too short.</p>
<p><strong>Prioritise</strong></p>
<p>In practice, it may not be possible to achieve a perfect solution. This could be due to cost constrains, or the fact that your mobile devices do not support perfect set of monitoring and management features. Whatever the source of these limitations, you should prioritise the questions you need to answer if you're going to spot potential compromise, or security risks.</p>
<p>The constraints of your mobile device management system, and the devices themselves, will tell you which solutions are practically achievable.</p>
<p><strong>Establish a SOC</strong></p>
<p>If your organisation has the resources available, one solution is to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/security-operations-centre-soc-buyers-guide">establish a security operation centre (SOC)</a>. This will help you manage and monitor security risks to your organisation generally.</p>
<p><strong>Logging made easy</strong></p>
<p>For some organisations, particularly smaller ones, establishing a SOC or implementing full scale professional monitoring solution may not be feasible.</p>
<p>However, at the very least, you should have an effective logging system in place.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/logging-made-easy">Logging Made Easy (LME)</a>&nbsp;is an NCSC open source project that provides a basic, end-to-end Windows logging capability, along with a set of tools for viewing and analysing the resulting data.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/logging-made-easy">LME</a>&nbsp;demonstrates that, with a modest investment of time and effort, it is possible to build a basic enterprise logging capability.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Technical notes</h2>
<h3><strong>Data sources vary between platforms</strong></h3>
<p>An effective monitoring solution will need to take account of the variation in data available between platforms.&nbsp;To help with this, we've listed some of the most important differences below.</p>
<p>In general, on-device logging, device compliance reporting and attestation capabilities should be combined with monitoring data from network-layer devices such as internal firewalls, network proxies, and the VPN gateway and service logs.&nbsp;This multi-dimensional view is what will give you the most effective overall monitoring capability.</p>

It works in combination with the built-in platform security features of Windows 10, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/exploit-protection">Exploit Protection</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/attack-surface-reduction">Attack Surface Reduction Rules</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-system-guard/system-guard-how-hardware-based-root-of-trust-helps-protect-windows">System Guard</a>, to reduce the&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/overview-attack-surface-reduction">attack surface</a>&nbsp;of Windows 10 devices. It includes capabilities such as&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/next-gen-threat-and-vuln-mgt">threat and vulnerability management</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/overview-endpoint-detection-response">end point detection and response</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/automated-investigations">automated investigation and remediation</a>. It also includes the&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/overview-secure-score">Microsoft secure score</a>&nbsp;that organisations can use to analyse and improve the security posture of mobile device security.&nbsp;</p>
          <p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/microsoft-defender-advanced-threat-protection">Windows Defender ATP</a>&nbsp;also integrates with Microsoft Intune to manage threats to devices, including&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/conditional-access">device compliance policies and conditional access</a>, e.g. to be able to restrict access to organisation services and data if a high risk threat is seen on a device.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
          <p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/protect-high-value-assets-by-controlling-the-health-of-windows-10-based-devices">Windows Device Health Attestation</a> can collect and report measured boot data, protected by a Trusted Platform Module (TPM). This data is transmitted to the Microsoft health attestation service to validate system boot integrity, including hardware and operating system boot components, kernel integrity, antivirus, and early boot drivers. It returns an encrypted health certificate that is stored on the device. This integrates with Microsoft Intune, so that the health certificate can be requested and used to validate specific device health data points as part of&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/compliance-policy-create-windows">device compliance policies</a>.&nbsp;It can, therefore, also be applied to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-compliant-device">conditional access policies</a>.</p>
