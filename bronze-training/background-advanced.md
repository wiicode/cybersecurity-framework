# Small Business Cyber Security: Ten Milestones
When dealing with the practicalities of cyber security it's extremely useful to understand what exactly you're protecting against. This guidance is designed to help organizations protect themselves in cyberspace. It breaks down the task of defending your networks, systems and information into its essential components, providing advice on how to achieve the best possible security in each of these areas. We believe that adopting security measures tailored to your situation, but which align with the 10 steps, will help protect your organization from cyber attack.


{.grid-list}
- [Risk Management *Why defining and communicating your Board’s Information Risk Management Regime is central to your organization’s overall cyber security strategy. Defining and communicating the organization’s attitude and approach to risk management is crucial. Boards may wish to consider communicating their risk management approach and policies across the organization to ensure that employees, contractors and suppliers are aware of the organization’s risk management boundaries.*](/bronze-training/background-advanced/10-steps-risk-management)
- [User education and awareness *Users have a critical role to play in their organization’s security and so it's important that security rules and the technology provided enable users to do their job as well as help keep the organization secure. This can be supported by a systematic delivery of awareness programs and training that deliver security expertise as well helping to establish a security-conscious culture.*](/bronze-training/background-advanced/10-steps-user-education)
- [Asset Managment *Incidents can occur as the result of not fully understanding an environment, whether it is an unpatched service, an exposed cloud storage account or a mis-classified document. Ensuring you know about all of these assets is a fundamental precursor to being able to understand and address the resulting risks.*](/bronze-training/background-advanced/10-steps-asset-management)
- [Secure Configuration *Having an approach to identify baseline technology builds and processes for ensuring configuration management can greatly improve the security of systems. You should develop a strategy to remove or disable unnecessary functionality from systems, and to quickly fix known vulnerabilities, usually via patching. Failure to do so is likely to result in increased risk of compromise of systems and information.*](/bronze-training/background-advanced/10-steps-secure-config)
- [Vulnerability Management *The majority of cyber security incidents are the result of attackers exploiting publicly disclosed vulnerabilities to gain access to systems and networks. Attackers will, often indiscriminately, seek to exploit vulnerabilities as soon as they have been disclosed.*](/bronze-training/background-advanced/10-steps-vulnerability-management)
- [Identity and Access Management *Giving users unnecessary system privileges or data access rights means that if the account is misused or compromised the impact will be more severe than it needs to be. Organizations should understand what level of access employees need to information, services and resources in order to do their job otherwise it won’t be possible to manage rights appropriately.*](/bronze-training/background-advanced/10-steps-user-privileges)
- [Data Security *In many cases data will be outside your direct control, so it important to consider the protections that you can apply as well as the assurances you may need from third parties. With the rise in increasingly tailored ransomware attacks preventing organizations from accessing their systems and data stored on them, other relevant security measures should include maintaining up-to-date, isolated, offline backup copies of all important data.*](/bronze-training/background-advanced/10-steps-risk-data-security)
- [Logging and Monitoring *System monitoring provides a capability that aims to detect actual or attempted attacks on systems and business services. Good monitoring is essential in order to effectively respond to attacks. In addition, monitoring allows you to ensure that systems are being used appropriately in accordance with organizational policies. Monitoring is often a key capability needed to comply with legal or regulatory requirements.*](/bronze-training/background-advanced/10-steps-monitoring)
- [Incident management *All organizations will experience security incidents at some point. Investment in establishing effective incident management policies and processes will help to improve resilience, support business continuity, improve customer and stakeholder confidence and potentially reduce any impact.*](/bronze-training/background-advanced/10-steps-incident-management)
- [Supply Chain Security *Supply chains are often large and complex, and effectively securing the supply chain can be hard because vulnerabilities can be inherent, introduced or exploited at any point within it. The first step is to understand your supply chain, including commodity suppliers such cloud service providers and those suppliers you hold a bespoke contract with.*](/bronze-training/background-advanced/10-steps-risk-supply-chain-security)

- [Home and mobile working *Mobile working and remote system access offers great business benefits but exposes new risks that need to be managed. You should establish risk based policies and procedures that support mobile working or remote access to systems that are applicable to users, as well as service providers.*](/bronze-training/background-advanced/10-steps-home-mobile)
- [Removable media controls *Removable media provide a common route for the introduction of malware and the accidental or deliberate export of sensitive data. You should be clear about the business need to use removable media and apply appropriate security controls to its use.*](/bronze-training/background-advanced/10-steps-removable-media)
- [Malware prevention *Malicious software, or malware is an umbrella term to cover any code or content that could have a malicious, undesirable impact on systems. Any exchange of information carries with it a degree of risk that malware might be exchanged, which could seriously impact your systems and services. The risk may be reduced by implementing appropriate security controls as part of an overall 'defense in depth' approach.*](/bronze-training/background-advanced/10-steps-malware-prevention)
- [Network security *The connections from your networks to the Internet, and other partner networks, expose your systems and technologies to attack. By creating and implementing some simple policies and appropriate architectural and technical responses, you can reduce the chances of these attacks succeeding (or causing harm to your organization). Your organization's networks almost certainly span many sites, and the use of mobile / remote working, and cloud services, makes defining a fixed network boundary difficult. Rather than focusing purely on physical connections, think also about where your data is stored and processed, and where an attacker would have the opportunity to interfere with it.*](/bronze-training/background-advanced/10-steps-network-security)
