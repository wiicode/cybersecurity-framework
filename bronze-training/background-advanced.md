- [Risk Management Regime *Why defining and communicating your Board’s Information Risk Management Regime is central to your organisation’s overall cyber security strategy.*](/bronze-training/10-steps)
- [Secure Configuration *Having an approach to identify baseline technology builds and processes for ensuring configuration management can greatly improve the security of systems. You should develop a strategy to remove or disable unnecessary functionality from systems, and to quickly fix known vulnerabilities, usually via patching. Failure to do so is likely to result in increased risk of compromise of systems and information.*](/bronze-training/10-steps)
- [Home and mobile working *Mobile working and remote system access offers great business benefits but exposes new risks that need to be managed. You should establish risk based policies and procedures that support mobile working or remote access to systems that are applicable to users, as well as service providers.*](/bronze-training/10-steps)
- [Incident management *All organisations will experience security incidents at some point. Investment in establishing effective incident management policies and processes will help to improve resilience, support business continuity, improve customer and stakeholder confidence and potentially reduce any impact.*](/bronze-training/10-steps)
- [Malware prevention *Malicious software, or malware is an umbrella term to cover any code or content that could have a malicious, undesirable impact on systems. Any exchange of information carries with it a degree of risk that malware might be exchanged, which could seriously impact your systems and services. The risk may be reduced by implementing appropriate security controls as part of an overall 'defence in depth' approach.*](/bronze-training/10-steps)
- [Managing user privileges *Giving users unnecessary system privileges or data access rights means that if the account is misused or compromised the impact will be more severe than it needs to be.*](/bronze-training/10-steps)
- [Monitoring *System monitoring provides a capability that aims to detect actual or attempted attacks on systems and business services. Good monitoring is essential in order to effectively respond to attacks. In addition, monitoring allows you to ensure that systems are being used appropriately in accordance with organisational policies. Monitoring is often a key capability needed to comply with legal or regulatory requirements.*](/bronze-training/10-steps)
- [Network security *The connections from your networks to the Internet, and other partner networks, expose your systems and technologies to attack. By creating and implementing some simple policies and appropriate architectural and technical responses, you can reduce the chances of these attacks succeeding (or causing harm to your organisation). Your organisation's networks almost certainly span many sites, and the use of mobile / remote working, and cloud services, makes defining a fixed network boundary difficult. Rather than focusing purely on physical connections, think also about where your data is stored and processed, and where an attacker would have the opportunity to interfere with it.*](/bronze-training/10-steps)
- [Removable media controls *Removable media provide a common route for the introduction of malware and the accidental or deliberate export of sensitive data. You should be clear about the business need to use removable media and apply appropriate security controls to its use.*](/bronze-training/10-steps)
- [User education and awareness *Users have a critical role to play in their organisation’s security and so it's important that security rules and the technology provided enable users to do their job as well as help keep the organisation secure. This can be supported by a systematic delivery of awareness programs and training that deliver security expertise as well helping to establish a security-conscious culture.*](/bronze-training/10-steps)
