Cyber criminals can use your email to access many of your personal accounts and find out vital personal information, such as your bank details, address or date of birth.

Having a strong, separate password for your email means that if cyber criminals steal the password for one of your less important accounts, they can’t use it to access your email account.

## Use three random words to create a strong password

A good way to create a strong and memorable password is to use three random words. Numbers and symbols can still be used if needed, for example `3redhousemonkeys27!`

Be creative and use words memorable to you, so that people can’t guess your password. Your social media accounts can give away vital clues about yourself so don’t use words such as your child’s name or favourite sports team which are easy for people to guess.

Cyber criminals are very smart and know many of the simple substitutions we use such as ‘Pa55word!” which utilizes symbols to replace letters.

Never use the following personal details for your password:

-   Current partner’s name
-   Child’s name
-   Other family members’ name
-   Pet’s name
-   Place of birth
-   Favorite holiday
-   Something related to your favorite sports team
