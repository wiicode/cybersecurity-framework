Most organizations rely upon suppliers to deliver products, systems, and services. You probably have a number of suppliers yourself, it's how we do business. 

Supply chains can be large and complex, involving many suppliers doing many different things. Effectively securing the supply chain can be hard because vulnerabilities can be inherent, or introduced and exploited at any point in the supply chain. A vulnerable supply chain can cause damage and disruption.

A series of high profile, very damaging attacks on companies has demonstrated that attackers have both the intent and ability to exploit vulnerabilities in supply chain security. This trend is real and growing. So, the need to act is clear.

> **A note on implementation:**
> Implementing these recommendations will take time, but the investment will be worthwhile. It will improve your overall resilience, reduce the number of business disruptions you suffer and the damage they cause.
