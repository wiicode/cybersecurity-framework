# What is cyber security?
Cyber security is the means by which individuals and organisations reduce the risk of being affected by cyber crime.

Cyber security's core function is to protect the devices we all use (smartphones, laptops, tablets and computers), and the services we access online - both at home and work - from theft or damage. It's also about preventing unauthorised access to the vast amounts of personal information we store on these devices, and online.

Cyber security is important because smartphones, computers and the internet are now such a fundamental part of modern life, that it's difficult to imagine how we'd function without them. From online banking and shopping, to email and social media, it's more important than ever to take steps that can prevent cyber criminals getting hold of our accounts, data, and devices. 

# You can improve your cyber security by taking six actions: 
> If hackers get into your device or accounts, they could access your money, your personal information, or information about your workplace or business.

### Separate Passwords

#### Use a strong and separate password for your email

Use a strong and separate password for your email
If a hacker gets into your email, they could:

- reset your other account passwords
- access information you have saved about yourself or your business
- Your email password should be strong and different to all your other passwords. This will make it harder to crack or guess.

Using 3 random words is a good way to create a strong, unique password that you will remember.

You should also protect your other important accounts, such as banking or social media.

### Strong Passwords 

#### Create strong passwords using 3 random words

When you use different passwords for your important accounts, it can be hard to remember them all.

A good way to create strong, memorable passwords is by using 3 random words.

Do not use words that can be guessed (like your pet’s name). You can include numbers and symbols if you need to. For example, “RedPantsTree4!”

Saving your passwords in your browser will help you manage them.

### Saved Passwords 

#### Save your passwords in your browser

Saving your password in your browser means letting your web browser (such as Chrome, Safari or Edge) remember your password for you.

This can help:

- make sure you do not lose or forget your passwords
- protect you against some cyber crime, such as fake websites
- It is safer than using weak passwords, or using the same password in more than one place.

Make sure you protect your saved passwords in case your device is lost or stolen.

#### How to protect your saved passwords
Someone who gets access to your device may be able to use your saved passwords to access your accounts.

This kind of cyber crime is much less common than remote attacks over the internet, where passwords are cracked using software.

To make sure you are protected, you should:

- turn off or lock your device when you are not using it
- use a strong password to protect your device
- turn on two-factor authentication for all your devices and accounts
- turn on biometrics (Face ID or Fingerprint recognition) if your device supports this

You should also back up your data regularly. This will help you recover your important information if your device is lost or stolen.


### Multi-Factor Auth 

#### Turn on two-factor authentication (2FA)

Two-factor authentication (2FA) helps to stop hackers from getting into your accounts, even if they have your password.

Some online banking uses 2FA automatically. It does this by asking for more information to prove your identity, such as:

- a PIN, password or code
- Biometrics - a fingerprint or face ID

#### How to turn on two-factor authentication (2FA)
You will need to manually turn on 2FA for most of your accounts. Not all accounts will offer 2FA. Online banking uses 2FA automatically.

2FA is also known as two-step verification or multi-factor authentication.

### Updates

#### Update your devices

Out-of-date software, apps, and operating systems contain weaknesses. This makes them easier to hack.

Companies fix the weaknesses by releasing updates. When you update your devices and software, this helps to keep hackers out.

Turn on automatic updates for your devices and software that offer it. This will mean you do not have to remember each time.

Some devices and software need to be updated manually. You may get reminders on your phone or computer. Do not ignore these reminders. Updating will help to keep you safe online.

#### How to turn on automatic updates

- [Microsoft Windows 10](ms-settings:windowsupdate)
- [Android smartphones and tablets](https://support.google.com/android/answer/7680439?hl=en-GB)


### Backup 

#### Back up your data

Backing up means creating a copy of your information and saving it to another device or to cloud storage (online).

Backing up regularly means you will always have a recent version of your information saved. This will help you recover quicker if your data is lost or stolen.

You can also turn on automatic backup. This will regularly save your information into cloud storage, without you having to remember.

If you back up your information to a USB stick or an external hard drive, disconnect it from your computer when a back up isn’t being done.

## Should I pay a ransom to unlock my computer?

If your device has become infected with ransomware, you are encouraged not to pay the ransom.

If you do pay:

- There is no guarantee that you will regain access to your data/device
- Your computer will still be infected unless you complete extensive clean-up activities
- Attackers may assume that you would be open to paying ransoms in the future
- You will be funding criminal groups

## My username and password have been stolen

Personal credentials, such as usernames and passwords, can be stolen directly from you by criminals using tricks such as phishing emails. They can also be stolen by hackers from the services you use, if they suffer a data breach. 

If you suspect either has happened, you should change your password as soon as possible.

If you have used the same password on any other accounts, you should change it there too.

Services such as www.haveibeenpwned.com can tell you if your information has ever been made public in a major data breach, and even alert you if it happens in the future.

## I might have malware on my device

If you believe your laptop, PC, tablet or phone has been infected with a virus or some other type of malware, there are steps you can take.

## I am worried that my banking details have been stolen

- Contact your bank or building society and speak to their fraud department.
- Your bank will not ask you to reply to an e-mail with personal information, or details about your account. If you contact them, use a phone number/email address you have found yourself, rather than one sent to you in the email – it may be false.
- You can check your credit reference file online. You should follow up on any unexpected or suspicious results.
