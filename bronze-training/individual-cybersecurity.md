What is cyber security?
Cyber security is the means by which individuals and organisations reduce the risk of being affected by cyber crime.

Cyber security's core function is to protect the devices we all use (smartphones, laptops, tablets and computers), and the services we access online - both at home and work - from theft or damage. It's also about preventing unauthorised access to the vast amounts of personal information we store on these devices, and online.

Cyber security is important because smartphones, computers and the internet are now such a fundamental part of modern life, that it's difficult to imagine how we'd function without them. From online banking and shopping, to email and social media, it's more important than ever to take steps that can prevent cyber criminals getting hold of our accounts, data, and devices. 

## You can improve your cyber security by taking six actions: {.tabset}

### Action 1 

#### Use a strong and separate password for your email

Use a strong and separate password for your email
If a hacker gets into your email, they could:

- reset your other account passwords
- access information you have saved about yourself or your business
- Your email password should be strong and different to all your other passwords. This will make it harder to crack or guess.

Using 3 random words is a good way to create a strong, unique password that you will remember.

You should also protect your other important accounts, such as banking or social media.

### Action 2 

#### Create strong passwords using 3 random words

When you use different passwords for your important accounts, it can be hard to remember them all.

A good way to create strong, memorable passwords is by using 3 random words.

Do not use words that can be guessed (like your pet’s name). You can include numbers and symbols if you need to. For example, “RedPantsTree4!”

Saving your passwords in your browser will help you manage them.

### Action 3 

#### Save your passwords in your browser

Saving your password in your browser means letting your web browser (such as Chrome, Safari or Edge) remember your password for you.

This can help:

- make sure you do not lose or forget your passwords
- protect you against some cyber crime, such as fake websites
- It is safer than using weak passwords, or using the same password in more than one place.

Make sure you protect your saved passwords in case your device is lost or stolen.

#### How to protect your saved passwords
Someone who gets access to your device may be able to use your saved passwords to access your accounts.

This kind of cyber crime is much less common than remote attacks over the internet, where passwords are cracked using software.

To make sure you are protected, you should:

- turn off or lock your device when you are not using it
- use a strong password to protect your device
- turn on two-factor authentication for all your devices and accounts
- turn on biometrics (Face ID or Fingerprint recognition) if your device supports this

You should also back up your data regularly. This will help you recover your important information if your device is lost or stolen.


### Action 4 

#### Turn on two-factor authentication (2FA)

Two-factor authentication (2FA) helps to stop hackers from getting into your accounts, even if they have your password.

Some online banking uses 2FA automatically. It does this by asking for more information to prove your identity, such as:

- a PIN, password or code
- Biometrics - a fingerprint or face ID

### Action 5 

#### Update your devices

Out-of-date software, apps, and operating systems contain weaknesses. This makes them easier to hack.

Companies fix the weaknesses by releasing updates. When you update your devices and software, this helps to keep hackers out.

Turn on automatic updates for your devices and software that offer it. This will mean you do not have to remember each time.

Some devices and software need to be updated manually. You may get reminders on your phone or computer. Do not ignore these reminders. Updating will help to keep you safe online.


### Action 6 

#### Back up your data

Backing up means creating a copy of your information and saving it to another device or to cloud storage (online).

Backing up regularly means you will always have a recent version of your information saved. This will help you recover quicker if your data is lost or stolen.

You can also turn on automatic backup. This will regularly save your information into cloud storage, without you having to remember.

If you back up your information to a USB stick or an external hard drive, disconnect it from your computer when a back up isn’t being done.
