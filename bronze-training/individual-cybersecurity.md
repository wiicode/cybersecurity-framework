What is cyber security?
Cyber security is the means by which individuals and organisations reduce the risk of being affected by cyber crime.

Cyber security's core function is to protect the devices we all use (smartphones, laptops, tablets and computers), and the services we access online - both at home and work - from theft or damage. It's also about preventing unauthorised access to the vast amounts of personal information we store on these devices, and online.

Cyber security is important because smartphones, computers and the internet are now such a fundamental part of modern life, that it's difficult to imagine how we'd function without them. From online banking and shopping, to email and social media, it's more important than ever to take steps that can prevent cyber criminals getting hold of our accounts, data, and devices.

### Action 1 

#### Use a strong and separate password for your email

Use a strong and separate password for your email
If a hacker gets into your email, they could:

reset your other account passwords
access information you have saved about yourself or your business
Your email password should be strong and different to all your other passwords. This will make it harder to crack or guess.

Using 3 random words is a good way to create a strong, unique password that you will remember.

You should also protect your other important accounts, such as banking or social media.
