<p>Implementing good cyber security measures is not only a key part of meeting your regulatory requirements but will also help reduce the likelihood of a significant incident. Implementing even very basic cyber security controls will help reduce the chance of an incident.&nbsp;</p>
<h1>What should the Board do?</h1>
<h3><br><strong>Get a little bit technical</strong></h3>
<p>Having a basic understanding of cyber security can help you to ask the right questions to seek assurance about your organization's cyber resilience&nbsp;&nbsp;- just as you would need to have a certain level of understanding of finance to assess the financial health of your organization. A good place to begin is to discuss your existing cyber security measures with your experts, and the questions below under 'What does good look like?'&nbsp; suggest a starting point for what to ask.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>What should your organization do?</h1>
<h3><br><strong>Start with a cyber security baseline</strong></h3>
<p>Attackers&nbsp;often use common methods to attack a network. A lot of these methods can be mitigated against by implementing basic cyber security controls.&nbsp;There are several frameworks that outline what good cyber security controls look like. These include the <strong>Bento Cyber Security Framework</strong>, ISO/IEC 27002 and <a href="https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework">NIST Cyber &nbsp;Framework</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Tailor your defenses to your highest priority risks</strong></h3>
<p>The basic cyber security controls will help mitigate against the most common cyber attacks, but once you have that baseline in place, you then need to tailor your defenses to mitigate&nbsp;<strong>your&nbsp;</strong>highest priority risks. Your measures will be tailored both to your technical estate (protecting the things you care about the most) and to the threat&nbsp; (protecting against methods used by specific threat actors).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Layer your defense</strong></h3>
<p>As with&nbsp;physical&nbsp;and personnel security, cyber security can make use of multiple measures which (when implemented simultaneously) help reduce the chances of single point of failure. This approach is commonly referred to as 'layered defense'. Each measure provides a layer of security and deployed collectively, greatly reduce the likelihood of a cyber incident. Once you have your cyber security baseline in place you can focus on layering your defense around those things that are most important to you - or particularly valuable to someone else.&nbsp;<br><br>For quick overview of what that may look like, see <a href="https://guides.techbento.com/en/bronze-checklists/layered-defense">BCSF Layered Defense Checklist</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Defend against someone inside your network</strong></h3>
<p>Defenses&nbsp;do not stop at the border of your network. A good defense assumes that an attacker will be able to access your system and works to&nbsp;<mark class="marker-yellow"><strong>minimize the harm that they can do</strong> </mark>once they are inside it.&nbsp;One of the key things you can do to limit the damage they can inflict is to restrict their movement and access. Effectively managing user privileges and segregating your network are common approaches. Identifying an attacker inside your system as soon as possible will also help limit the damage they can do.&nbsp;<strong>Monitoring and logging</strong>&nbsp;are key to being able to spot any signs of malicious&nbsp;activity.</p>
<p>These measures will also help mitigate the threat from a malicious insider; somebody who has legitimate access to your systems but then uses that access to do harm. This threat ranges in capability and intent, from a disgruntled employee through to corporate espionage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Review and assess your measures&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>Good cyber security is a continuous cycle of having the right information, making informed decisions and taking action to reduce the risk. You will need to be continuously assessing and adapting your defenses as the needs&nbsp;of&nbsp;your organization and the profile of the threat changes.&nbsp;To do this it's important to have some way to assess whether your defenses are effective.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are several mechanisms available to technically assess the effectiveness of your security controls. This may include things like testing the security of your networks (pen-testing) through to certification of products or services. You may want to use a combination of internal mechanisms and objective assessment provided by an external source.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Engaging&nbsp;with staff will also help you gain a more accurate picture of your organization’s defenses. It will also give you the opportunity to get valuable staff input into how policies or processes could be improved. Metrics or indicators can also tell you where you need to change your approach or adapt to new circumstances. Understanding exactly what an indicator is telling you may require further investigation of the situation. An example is the trend in people reporting suspicious emails. A decline in the number of people reporting can either mean fewer malicious emails are getting through to people’s inboxes, or&nbsp;it could mean fewer people are&nbsp;reporting any concerns because they don't receive feedback when they do, and therefore believe nothing is ever done afterwards.</p>
<h1>What does good look like?</h1>
<p>The following questions&nbsp;can be used to generate productive discussions with your technical team. The aim is to identify what constitutes 'good' cyber&nbsp;security in terms of&nbsp;assessing your organization's cyber security measures.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><br><strong>Q1. As an </strong>organization<strong>, how do we assure ourselves that our measures are effective?</strong></h3>
<p>You might seek this assurance through</p>
<ul>
  <li>Penetration testing&nbsp;carried out by an external organization, and action taken on the back of their results.</li>
  <li>Automated testing of your defenses and monitoring of activity on your networks&nbsp;by your IT security team.</li>
  <li>Reviewing defensive measures&nbsp;against suitable frameworks, this could be an internal review or an independent consultant. Suitable frameworks include the <strong>Bento Cyber Security Framework</strong>, ISO/IEC 27002 and <a href="https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework">NIST Cyber &nbsp;Framework</a>.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Ensuring threat assessments and defensive priorities are regularly reviewed and defensive measures updated accordingly.</li>
  <li>Ensuring that the focus of your cyber security measures is aligned with the risks you have identified and prioritized.</li>
</ul>
<h3><br><strong>Q2. As an </strong>organization<strong>, what measures do we take to minimize the damage an attacker could do inside our network?</strong></h3>
<p>You might&nbsp;consider:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How you authenticate and&nbsp;grant access to users or systems. You want to ensure that these measures are not easy to bypass and that you don't afford access unless necessary.</li>
  <li>How you would identify an attacker's presence on your networks - normally done through monitoring.</li>
  <li>How you separate your network so that if an attacker gets access to one device they do not have access to the full range of your technical estate.<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h3><br><strong>Q3. As an </strong>organization<strong>, do we implement cyber security controls to defend against the most common attacks?</strong></h3>
