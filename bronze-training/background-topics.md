- [Approaching enterprise technology with cyber security in mind*The majority of cyber attacks an organization faces will be ineffective if enterprise technology is deployed, operated, and maintained with cyber security in mind. This guidance explains how organizations should approach enterprise technology in order to deter cyber attacks.*](/bronze-training/background-topics/enterprise-technology-security)
- [Growing positive security cultures*Security culture, and how to improve it, is a hot topic for many organizations. This is a good thing, because - I think we can all agree - healthy and positive security cultures actively contribute to supporting and enabling business. Poor security cultures can undermine the efforts of otherwise diligent staff.*](/bronze-training/background-topics/topic-culture)

# Governance
{.grid-list}
- [Introduction to security governance*Security governance is the means by which you control and direct your organization’s approach to security. When done well, security governance will effectively coordinate the security activities of your organization. It enables the flow of security information and decisions around your organization.*](/bronze-training/background-topics/governance-1-intro)
- [Security governance, enabling sensible risk management decisions & communication*Governing how risks to technology systems are managed should be no different to the way organizations govern other business activities. The term governance implies that an organization actively exercises control over the risks it faces and provides direction for the security of its business. Effective security governance requires that organizations invest in risk management resources and trust decision makers, so that it has the right people, structures and processes in place. This enables sensible risk management decision making in pursuit of the organizations business goals and objectives.*](/bronze-training/background-topics/governance-2-comms)

# Risk Management
{.grid-list}
- [Introduction to the risk management for cyber security guidance*Every organization has to make difficult decisions around how much time and money to spend protecting their technology and services; one of the main goals of risk management is to inform and improve these decisions. People have had to deal with dangers throughout history, but it’s only relatively recently that they’ve been able do so in a way that systematically anticipates and aspires to control risk. The purpose of this guidance is to give you a range of risk management techniques which will help you improve the decisions you make with regard to cyber security.*](/bronze-training/background-topics/risk-1-intro)
- [The fundamentals of risk*This section focuses on the fundamental principles of risk management. Here, we won’t be talking about standards or policies, or even anything directly to do with cyber security. Rather, we'll be introducing some fundamental principles of risk management, which are relevant whether you’re studying disease outbreaks, the rise and fall of stock markets, or the risks of a cyber attack.*](/bronze-training/background-topics/risk-2-fundamentals)
- [Get the basics right: risk management principles for cyber security*This section describes some basic risk management principles that will suffice for most small and medium sized enterprises (SMBs) or sole proprietors.*](/bronze-training/background-topics/risk-3-principles)
- [Variety in risk information*Why recognizing different types of information is essential when assessing cyber risk. Risk information is any information which can influence a decision. Some organizations have a tendency to only accept certain types of information as legitimate risk information. Such limitations increase the chance of something important being missed.*](/bronze-training/background-topics/risk-4-riskinfo)
