# What can we do to be secure?
The BCSF is often asked 'what does good look like?' The simple answer is 'whatever protects the things you care about'. This means that, whilst there is some good practice that applies in most situations, 'good' cyber security for one organization may not be 'good' for another. 'Good' cyber security has to work for you; it has to be appropriate to your systems, your processes, your staff, your culture and, critically, has to be appropriate for the level of risk you are willing to accept.
