<p>The&nbsp;role of cyber security is to enable the organisation's objectives and, increasingly, enable competitive advantage. It should be adding value to your organisation rather than hindering progress. This requires a positive cyber security culture and appropriate investment and management of cyber security.&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<h2>What should the Board do?</h2>
<h3><strong>Integrate cyber security into your organisation's objectives and&nbsp;risks</strong></h3>
<p>There's two reasons why this is so important.</p>
<p>Firstly, cyber security impacts on every aspect of your organisation. Therefore to manage it properly it must be integrated into organisational risk management and decision making. For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Operational&nbsp;risk&nbsp;will likely be underpinned by cyber security because of the reliance on the security of digital services that you use (email services, bespoke software, etc.)</li>
  <li>Some legal risk will be tied in with cyber security risk&nbsp; (such as contractual requirements to protect data or partnerships, regulatory requirements to handle data in particular ways)</li>
  <li>Financial risk is impacted by cyber security (such as money lost through fraud enabled by cyber, revenue lost when services are taken offline by cyber attack)</li>
  <li>Good cyber security will also allow you to take some risk in using new technology to innovate.&nbsp;An overly cautious approach to risk can lead to missed business opportunities or additional (and unnecessary) costs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Secondly, cyber security needs to be integrated for it to be successful. Good cyber security isn't just about having good technology, it's about people having a good relationship with security, and having the right processes in place across the organisation to manage it.</p>
<p>For example, in order to protect against&nbsp;an attacker accessing sensitive data (whilst ensuring that only those with a current and valid requirement&nbsp;can see it), you will need:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a good technical solution to storing the data</li>
  <li>appropriate&nbsp;training for staff handling the data</li>
  <li>a process around managing the movement of staff, aligned with access management&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Reflect this in your structure</strong></h3>
<p>Don't leave it to one person; Cyber&nbsp;security is the responsibility of the&nbsp;<strong>entire Board</strong>.</p>
<p>A cyber security incident will affect the whole organisation - not&nbsp;just the IT&nbsp;department. For example, it may impact on online sales, impact on contractual relationships or result in legal or regulatory action.&nbsp;There should be&nbsp;sufficient&nbsp;expertise within the Board in order to provide direction on cyber security strategy and hold decisions to account. However every member of the Board needs enough expertise to understand how it impacts specifically upon their area of focus, and to understand the broad implications for the organisation as a whole.</p>
<h3><strong>Cyber security outside the UK</strong></h3>
<p>When trying to understand the impact of cyber security on your organisation and your risks, an important consideration is which countries your organisation operates in. For those organisations who operate outside the UK or have partners outside the UK, the CPNI Smart Business Guidance highlights how this may impact your security considerations, including your cyber security. The <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/board-toolkit/collaborating-with-suppliers-and-partners">Collaborating with suppliers and partners</a> section of this toolkit provides guidance on how to mitigate the cyber security risk associated with these relationships.</p>
<h3><strong>Engage with your experts</strong></h3>
<p>Consider whether your reporting structure enables the Board to have the engagement with cyber security that it needs. If the CISO reports to a intermediary to the Board who has a focus on only one aspect - be that finance or legal or technology - this can potentially hinder the ability for the Board to see cyber security's wider implications. In the majority of FTSE350 organisations the CISO now reports directly to the Board.</p>
<p>A good place to start on improving cyber security in your organisation is to consider the communication between&nbsp;experts&nbsp;and members of the Board. Getting the structure right can help, but we also often see a reluctance from both parties to engage, because:</p>
<p>technical staff think that the Board won't understand them</p>
<p>the Board think that the technical staff&nbsp;are unable to explain the issues in the context of the strategic aims of the organisation</p>
<p>Improving the communication between these two groups requires effort from both sides:</p>
<p><strong>Boards</strong>&nbsp;need a good enough understanding of&nbsp;cyber security that they can understand how cyber security supports their&nbsp;overall organisational objectives</p>
<p><strong>technical staff&nbsp;</strong>need to appreciate that communication of cyber risk is&nbsp;a core component of their&nbsp;job, and ensure they understand their role in contributing to the organisation's&nbsp;objectives</p>
<hr>
<h2>What does good look like?</h2>
<p>The following questions&nbsp;can be used to generate productive discussions with your technical team. The aim is to identify what constitutes 'good' cyber security in terms of <strong>embedding cyber security into your structure and objectives</strong>.</p>
<h3><strong>Q1. As a Board, do we understand how cyber security impacts upon our individual and collective responsibilities?</strong></h3>
<p>You might want to consider</p>
<ul>
  <li>Does every Board member have enough expertise to&nbsp;understand the potential impact and value of cyber security?</li>
  <li>Is there someone responsible for delivering the organisation's cyber security?</li>
  <li>Who is responsible for oversight&nbsp;of&nbsp;cyber security?</li>
  <li>Have we been clear about what information both the Board and our wider stakeholders need?</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Q2. As an organisation, who currently has responsibility for cyber security?</strong></h3>
<p>This could be a person or a function, e.g. an audit committee. You might want to consider:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How they engage with the board - do they report directly to the Board or do they fit into another reporting process? Does this encourage the Board to actively participate in discussions on cyber security?</li>
  <li>What their objectives are and who sets them - do these objectives drive cyber security to be an enabler for the organisation?</li>
  <li>Do they have access to all the people they need to ensure effective cyber security - this could be just in terms of the resource required to meet your cyber security objectives, but could also be the teams that they need to be linked in with e.g. HR, policy, finance</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Q3. As a Board, how do we assure ourselves that our organisation's cyber security measures are effective?</strong></h3>
<p>You might want assurance that</p>
<ul>
  <li>The organisation is employing an appropriate suite of technical assurance activities&nbsp;and the output of this is conveyed in a meaningful way to the Board. Assurance activities might include reviewing defensive measures&nbsp;against suitable frameworks, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cyberessentials.ncsc.gov.uk/">Cyber Essentials</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/10-steps-to-cyber-security">10 Steps to Cyber Security</a>.</li>
  <li>Threat assessments and defensive priorities are regularly reviewed and defensive measures updated accordingly.</li>
  <li>The focus of your cyber security measures is aligned with the risks you have identified and prioritised.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Q4. As an organisation, do we have a process that ensures cyber risk is integrated with business risk?</strong></h3>
<p>An example of this would be where a risk from one part of the organisation has been balanced against another.&nbsp;For example, an organisation may assess that introducing a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)&nbsp;policy brings substantial benefit to the organisation in terms of flexible working. As part of the case for change, including assessing the business risk of not implementing a BYOD model, you would also want to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Assess the increase in risk associated with the increased number of devices connected to your network.</li>
  <li>Assess the risk associated with not owning, and therefore not being in control of, devices connected to your network.</li>
  <li>Consciously balance the business risks and benefits with the technical risks and benefits of BYOD.</li>
  <li>Consider other models, such as Corporate Owned, Personally Enabled (COPE) and compare the risks and benefits.</li>
  <li>Assess the suitability of planned security measures to ensure that they support rather than constrain the aims of flexible working.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this example, the cyber risk of introducing the new service (BYOD) has been integrated into the business risk. Those who are accountable for a service should be receiving the best possible advice, so that they can clearly balance cyber risks with other risks (and benefits) in their decision making.</p>
