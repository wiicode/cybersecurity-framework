# Learning and Training

> IBM’s “2014 Cyber Security Intelligence Index” reported that 95 percent of all security incidents involve human error. In 2016 they added that 60 percent of breaches are a result of insiders. Many of these are successful security attacks prey on human weakness in order to lure insiders within organizations to unwittingly provide them with access to sensitive information.

# Training Materials
> Humans are the primary vulnerability in majority of the scams and hacks that affect today’s small business. It is important to understand that, despite the plethora of vulnerabilities and exploits available to attackers, the ones that are low-effort and high-reward are the greatest threat to a business. Passwords, attachments, and links are the lowest-effort means of exploitation, and all are at full control and discretion of the people working for the organization. Whether it is through human error or willful acts, humans factors are the of greatest concern in cybersecurity.

Cyber security researchers can generally find 359 ways to compromise your systems, but not all will work for your business.  BCSF encourages companies delop their own materials rather than outousrce that responsibility to tools and subscriptions.  With that said, a subscription may be part of your program, but it should not be the whole process.  A successful program often includes:

- Policies and Procedures training during onboarding and annually.
- Regular team meetings where cyber security is given 1-5 minutes.
- Case studies and stories of compromise for review.
- Security Awareness testing. 
- Insider threat detection. 

## People's Attitudes
There are also five hazardous attitudes which contribute to the general vulnerabilities staff, managers, and owners. Like most things in security, or even human nature, they are not binary and exist on spectrums. All present a threat an organization and they are: impulsivity, invulnerability, machismo, resignation, and anti-authority.

### Tabs {.tabset}
#### Impulsivity

Impulsivity is attributed to heavy workloads and due to the general demand competitive work environments. Often, staff are attempting to get work done quickly. In the flurry of activity they can easily can mis-click, misread, or misinterpret an obvious threat or dismiss it after it had been triggered.

#### Invulnerability

Invulnerability is mostly associated with managers, or owners, and represents the false assumption that they are too small, too insignificant, or too simple to be a targeted. Such individuals often have fast, or direct, responses to security concerns and have taken basic measures to protect systems. The incomplete understanding of the cybersecurity landscape leads to profound gaps in the security process for the organization and general shortsightedness.

#### Machismo

Machismo is a compliment to invulnerability and also is a quality of managers and owners. Generally, it is associated with lack of sufficient understanding of security and threat management technologies, and thus fail to see the inadequacies of such controls. Suggesting that the mere presence of a firewall is sufficient to protect a system is an example.

#### Resignation

Resignation can vary with roles and is the effective surrender to threats. For managers, resignation is choosing not to do the work necessary to prevent incidents or transferring the responsibility for dealing with an incident to someone else instead of managing it. For staff, it is failing to learn safe computing practices, take training seriously, or act thoughtfully when faced with an incident.

#### Anti-authority

Anti-authority is a non-conformist approach to cybersecurity. Despite being connected to the same internet, using similar hardware, working with the same software as most organizations around the world, anti-authoritarian managers and owners chose to avoid the work, fail to comply with standards, ignore education opportunities. Such individuals continue to conduct business as they always have and have not yet come to terms that the current cybersecurity needs.
