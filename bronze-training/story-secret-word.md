# The Tale of the Secret Word.

Many months ago a team of very ambitious hackers leaked some data from Yahoo, along with LastPass, Ashley Madison, Anthem, E-Bay, JP Morgan Chase, Home Depot, Sony, Target, Global Payments, Tricare, Citibank, Heartland, and countless smaller companies that have yet to figure it out. The data varied in scope and quality, but in nearly all cases it contained an email address, basic info, and even passwords.

Despite there being billions of data records, the information was relatively easy to transfer and later process. Another team, or maybe just one person, signed up for a free introductory Microsoft Azure account and pumped the data through their super-computers. Although the quantity of data seemed large, the free tier was sufficient to process and cleanup and consolidate all the information. The result was an application that knew many of the credentials that you used, specifically the usernames and passwords, with the ability to try them at other sites.

Over a relatively short period of time, more ambitious scammers used this information to establish profiles on millions of individuals with weak password practices and began targeting their accounts.
Using nothing more than the super-powerful cloud infrastructure available to every person with a credit card and a phone number, they infiltrated inboxes, dating sites, shopping sites, wireless providers, cable and satellite television providers, social media, banks, and domain registrars.

Among those credentials was your personal email secured by the word “pickles”, a credential combination that scored well in all the tests. Knowing that this was a common password and having a general idea of what companies you have done business with in the past, the automated system began trying your credentials.
Although the known combinations did not work for your business mailbox, it did work for a GoDaddy account which you accessed once every few years. The account was flagged for an attacker to explore it further.
With minimal effort, sometime early Sunday morning, a sixteen-year-old kid sitting in their parents bedroom pointed your domain records to her own servers and began the process of resetting passwords to all services that were attached to this email address. By controlling the domain records this attacker could re-route e-mail to their own servers, pretend to be you, and gain access to all other aspects of your company including banks, payroll, and internal data.

Recognizing there was more to gain, they put everything back to the way it was, but then used the newly acquired credentials to access the real mailbox, skim data, and ultimately access your company systems. After all, your inbox had credit card numbers, passwords you shared with staff, and a host of other personally identifiable information.

Sunday morning you did have trouble accessing e-mail, but Steve was not around and it was a nice day anyways. On Monday, after starting the day at the office, you suddenly became acutely aware that you you lost total control over your business and your digital life.

## Lesson: Email Account Compromise.

Email account compromise is a sister scam to BEC. EAC differs from BEC in that it targets individuals or individual professionals instead of businesses.

EAC is defined as a sophisticated scam that targets the general public and professionals associated with, but not limited to, financial and lending institutions, real estate companies, and law firms. As in BEC, subjects use compromised emails to request payments to fraudulent locations. The EAC scenario has been reported by victims over a long period of time; however, specific tracking of victims began in July 2015 as BEC subjects began to overlap. Some EAC complaints were originally categorized as BEC, but have since further been identified as being EAC. In 2015, the IC3 received 281 complaints identified as EAC with losses of over $11 million.
