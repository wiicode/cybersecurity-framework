If you suspect your PC, tablet or phone has been infected with a virus or some other form of malware, follow these three steps to remove the infection and restore your device.

## 1. Confirm your device is infected

+ **You may already know for sure** because your antivirus product is telling you it has found an infection, or your device is showing ransomware asking you to pay money. 
+ **If you suspect an infection** but aren't sure. The easiest way to confirm an infection on a PC or laptop is to run an antivirus scan and see if it detects anything.
+ I**f you don't have antivirus**, signs of infection include:
1. [ ] Your device is running slowly, rebooting by itself, frequently closes programs or apps you are using, or opens those you are not.
2. [ ] You have pop-up boxes from programs/apps you don't recognise, asking you to do unexpected things.
3. [ ]  Someone you know tells you that they've received unexpected emails from you, advertising unlikely products, or perhaps asking for money.

+ **If you have received a phone call** telling you your device is infected and you need their help to clear it up. This is a common scam, the caller often claiming to be from a trusted company such as Microsoft, or your internet service provider. Hang up immediately. If such a caller has persuaded you to pay them money, report the call to your bank or credit card provider.

## 2. Try and fix the infection

+ **If you are on a phone or tablet**:
1. [ ] These can't usually be fixed by an antivirus product in the same way as PCs and laptops. The safest solution is to do a factory reset - you can usually find this option in the Settings.
1. [ ] If this doesn't fix the problem, you'll need expert help.
+ **If you are using a PC or laptop**:
1. [ ] Update your device and programs
1. [ ] Open your antivirus product and run a scan, then follow its advice
1. [ ] If your AV *can’t clean *your device up – you’ll have to wipe it entirely and re-install everything, starting with your operating system. You may need to get expert help to do this.
1. [ ] If you* cannot download and install* an antivirus product because your web browser (eg Chrome, Edge, Firefox) is infected, you will probably need to get expert help.
+ **Restore your backed-up data from the 'last known' good backup**. You will lose any data that wasn't backed up, but trying to rescue data while your device is still infected runs the risk of carrying the infection through after wiping and re-installing.

## 3. After you've fixed the infection

1. [ ] Follow our advice for setting up your devices securely and keeping them safe
1. [ ] Keep your device and programs/apps up to date
1. [ ] Back up your data
1. [ ] Check your device is encrypted
1. [ ] For PCs and laptops, make sure you have antivirus and that it's updating regularly
