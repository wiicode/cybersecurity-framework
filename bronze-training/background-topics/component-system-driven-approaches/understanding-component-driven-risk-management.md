The principles of component-driven risk management in cyber security.
Component-driven risk assessments are the most mature and common types of assessment within the cyber security profession. This section describes what component-driven techniques have in common, where they add value, and where they don't.

- Once you've understood these basics, you should be able to pick up any component-driven standard or framework (as they are based on a similar perspective on risk) and understand how they differ from system-driven approaches.
- If you've not already done so, please read Introducing component-driven and system-driven risk assessments before reading this section.

# Scope and assets
Unsurprisingly, component-driven risk assessments are focused on system components. So what do we mean by 'system components'? Typical examples include:

- hardware (computers, servers, etc.)
- software
- data sets
- services
- personal information
- business critical information
- staff

The focus on system components requires you to start by defining the function that you are analyzing (for example, a payroll function). This function is known as the 'scope' of your assessment. You then need to state which components you are considering in your risk assessment of the scope, and which you aren't. This is generally referred to as an 'asset list' or 'asset register'.

Components which you have no control over (but which your own system depends on) are known as dependencies, and can be included alongside your asset list, provided as long it is clear how these dependencies affect those components which you can control. A scope is sometimes best presented as a diagram, which clearly shows what is in, what is out, and how the key assets are connected.

# Elements of risk
Once you have identified your scope, most component-driven approaches require the risk analyst to assess three elements of risk. These three elements are typically described by the terms impact, vulnerability and threat.

## Impact
Impact is the consequences of a risk being realized. When conducting component-driven risk assessments, impact is usually described in terms of the consequences of a given asset being compromised in a given way. This impact is described in different ways, but one of the more common techniques is to assess the impacts to confidentiality, integrity and availability, of information. For example, an impact might be described in terms of a loss of confidentiality of a customer dataset, or the corruption (loss of integrity) of your company's accounts. A loss of one of these properties can be connected to other types of consequence, such as lost money, loss of life, delays to projects, or any other kind of undesirable outcome.

## Vulnerability
A vulnerability is a weakness in a component that would enable an impact to be realized, either deliberately, or by accident. For instance, a vulnerability could be a piece of software which allows a user to illegitimately increase their user account privileges, or a weakness in a business process (e.g. not properly checking the identity of someone before issuing them credentials for access to an online system or service). Regardless of the type of vulnerability in question, it is something which can be used to cause a impact.

## Threat
Threat is the individual, group or circumstance which causes a given impact to occur. For example, this could be:

- a lone hacker, or a state-sponsored group
- a member of staff who has made an honest mistake
- a situation beyond the control of the organization (such as high-impact weather)

The purpose of assessing threat is to improve the assessment of how likely a given risk is to be realized. Typically, when assessing a human threat actor, analysts consider people who are likely to want to harm the organization. This then allows them to consider both the capability and intent of these groups. Risk experts use threat taxonomies and categorisation methods to provide a common language of threat capability.

One of the weaknesses of threat assessments is that a threat's capability can change rapidly, and reliable information on these changes can be hard to come by. Because of this, don't treat your assessments of threat capability as if they are static, and make sure you recognize uncertainty and variability in your threat assessments.

# Applying and communicating threat, vulnerability and impact
Once these elements of risk have been assessed, the next step is to combine these assessments to identify which risks are most concerning. Some techniques do this by combining the assessments of threat, vulnerability and impact into a single measurement of risk for each system component. This is not as straightforward as some standards claim; the three components of risk are fundamentally different from each other, and comparing them is like comparing apples with oranges. Some approaches recommend the use of risk matrices to combine assessments of threat, vulnerability and impact.

## Prioritising your risks
Once the various threats, vulnerabilities and impacts have been assessed and combined to create a list of risks, they can be prioritized according to how concerning they are. This allows you to manage the most concerning risks first. You can communicate this prioritisation of risks in a variety of ways. For example, you could:

- estimate the financial loss of an impact, if it were to be realized
- provide a narrative of the chain of events that would need to occur if an asset were to be compromised

Many standardized component-driven risk management techniques use qualitative labels to describe levels of impact, usually with labels like 'high', 'medium' and 'low'. Whilst these are fairly intuitive, research shows that there is a huge difference between how different individuals interpret these labels. When considering this lack of consistency of understanding, these labels (and similar 'traffic light' approaches) should be used very cautiously. The technique you use should be tailored to the risk assessment's audience; who is it seeking to influence? What decision are you trying to inform? Does the information you are presenting from your assessment aid decision making or hinder it?

Some approaches have a ready-made list of tasks or objectives that can be used to mitigate the risks you have identified. These are known as 'control sets', from which you can select the most appropriate set of mitigations for each risk.

# Commonly used component-driven cyber risk management methods and frameworks
This section provides a brief description of commonly used component-driven cyber risk management methods and frameworks. Click on the relevant hyperlinks for more detailed information about each method/framework. There are many more component-driven risk management techniques which have not been listed here. This list does not include system-driven techniques.

## Selecting a technique that's right for you
When selecting a risk method or framework, you need to consider:

- The overall cost of using the method. For example, the procurement of tools, licensing and expertise.
- The scope of the project. Is the risk method proportionate to what is being assessed?
- Ensuring the required resources are proportionate and sustainable. What specialist resources are required, and do you have them?
- Are there any licensing restrictions?
