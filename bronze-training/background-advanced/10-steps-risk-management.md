# Summary
Taking risks is a natural part of doing business. Risk management informs decisions so that the right balance of threats and opportunities can be achieved to best deliver your business objectives. Risk management in the cyber security domain helps ensure that the technology, systems and information in your organization are protected in the most appropriate way, and that resources are focussed on the things that matter most to your business. A good risk management approach will be embedded throughout your organization and complement the way you manage other business risks.

Organizations rely on technology, systems and Information to support their business goals. It is important that organizations apply a similar level of rigor to assessing the risks to its technology, systems and information assets as it would to other risks that might have a material business impact, such as regulatory, financial or operational risks. This can be achieved by embedding an appropriate risk management regime across the organization, which is actively supported by the board, senior managers and an empowered governance structure.

Defining and communicating the organization’s attitude and approach to risk management is crucial. Boards may wish to consider communicating their risk management approach and policies across the organization to ensure that employees, contractors and suppliers are aware of the organization’s risk management boundaries.

# What is the risk?
Taking risk is a necessary part of doing business in order to create opportunities and help deliver business objectives. For any organization to operate successfully it needs to address risk and respond proportionately and appropriately to a level which is consistent with what risks an organization is willing, or not, to tolerate. If an organization does not identify and manage risk it can lead to business failure.

The lack of an effective risk management and governance structure may lead to the following:

- Exposure to risk: Without effective governance processes the Board will be unlikely to understand and manage the overall risk exposure of the organization.
- Missed business opportunities: Risk decisions taken within a dedicated security function, rather than organizationally, will be motivated by achieving high levels of security. This may promote an overly cautious approach to risk leading to missed business opportunities or additional cost.
- Ineffective policy implementation: The board has overall ownership of the corporate security policy. Without effective risk management and governance processes the Board won't have confidence that its stated policies are being consistently applied across the business as a whole.

# How can the risk be managed?
**Establish a governance framework**:  A governance framework needs to be established that enables and supports a consistent and empowered approach to risk management across the organization, with ultimate responsibility residing at board level;

**Determine what risks an organization is willing to tolerate and what is unacceptable**: Agree what risks you are prepared to tolerate in pursuit of your business objectives. Produce guidance and statements that helps individuals throughout the organization make appropriate risk based decisions.

**Maintain board engagement**: The board should regularly review risks that may arise from an attack on technology or systems used. To ensure senior ownership and oversight, the risks resulting from attack should be documented in the corporate risk register and regularly reviewed. Entering into knowledge sharing partnerships with other companies and law enforcement, and joining the CiSP Information Sharing Platform, can help you understand new and emerging threats as well as share approaches and mitigations that might work.

**Produce supporting policies**: An overarching technology and security risk policy should be created and owned by the board to help communicate and support risk management objectives, setting out the risk management strategy for the organization as a whole.

**Adopt a lifecycle approach to risk management**: Technology changes, as does the threat and therefore risks change over time. A continuous through-life process needs to be adopted to ensure security controls remain effective and appropriate.

**Apply recognized standards**: Consider the application of recognized sources of security management good practice, such as the ISO/IEC 27000 series of standards.

**Make use of endorsed assurance schemes**: Consider adopting the Cyber Essentials Scheme. It provides guidance on the basic controls that should be put in place to manage risk of online cyber attack to enterprise technology and offers a certification process that demonstrates your commitment to cyber security.

**Educate users and maintain awareness**: All users have a responsibility to help manage security risks. Provide appropriate training and user education that is relevant to their role and refresh it regularly. Encourage staff to participate in knowledge sharing exchanges with peers across your organization and beyond.

**Promote a risk management culture**: Risk management needs to be organization-wide, driven by corporate governance from the top down, with user participation demonstrated at every level of the business.

# What are the benefits?

Whether you are new to cyber risk management, or you are trying to assess the efficacy of your existing approach, this guidance will help you build an understanding of what a good approach to risk management looks like, in the context of your organization.

# What should you do?

## Think about the wider context in which you want to manage cyber risk.
- Think about what your organization does, and what it cares about. What are the business priorities and objectives? This may seem a strange starting point for cyber security but it sets the scene for your cyber risk management. Cyber risk management is not separate to what your organization wants to achieve but should support your organizational objectives. Thinking about the risks you would (or would not) be willing to take with technology to achieve your aims and objectives will help you make decisions about the steps to take to manage the cyber security risk.
- Consider what governance structures are in place to manage other types of business risk. How does managing and communicating about cyber risk fit within those structures? Effective governance is important for good cyber security risk management because it controls and directs the activities and actions an organization takes to manage the cyber security risks it faces. Your approach to managing cyber security related risks should be governed effectively in ways that work for your organization.
- Ensure that the organization has adequate policies approved and owned by the board that set out the risk management strategy for the organization as a whole, and that cyber security is considered in other organizational policies where appropriate. You should ensure that your board collectively has a good enough understanding of cyber security that they understand how cyber security supports their overall organizational objectives. They should get the information they need, in a format that they understand, at the time they need it to enable decision-making.

## Understand where you need to apply cyber risk management
- Think about the range of technology, systems, services and information that your organization uses and relies on to achieve its organizational goals and priorities. You should use a variety of sources of information to help you identify this scope. For example, for existing systems you could use asset registers and system diagrams; for systems in development you can start with high level designs. Talking to those who use, manage or are affected by the systems or services will also give you useful insights into what you want to protect, and why. For further information see our Asset Management step to help you get started.
- Remember to include elements that may be outside of your direct control, but are still part of your wider risk concerns (such as your supply chain, use of third party services and cloud services.
- Don’t forget to think about how people interact with technology, systems and services. How they are supported to do this in secure and usable ways contributes to your management of the organization’s cyber security risks. Systems involve people, processes and technology and your approach to cyber risk management should take account of these different elements and how they interact with each other.

## Choose a cyber security risk management approach that is right for your organization
- Think about what approach to cyber security risk management, or mix of approaches, is right for your organization. There are numerous tools, methods, frameworks and standards to choose from - some may be stipulated for you through standards or regulations, some you need to pay for, others are free to use. It is important that you choose an approach that is right for your business and one that will reveal good risk information about your systems and services.
- Understand that it is not always necessary to carry out a detailed risk assessment. For example, you could use a baseline such as Cyber Essentials to provide information on the basic controls needed to protect your organization against most common internet-based attacks. However, using a baseline such as Cyber Essentials on its own has its limitations in that only the risks generally considered by the Cyber Essentials scheme will be covered by its recommended controls. They have not been designed to manage all cyber security related risks that your organization may face. To gain a more tailored perspective, organizations will need to conduct risk analysis and assessment for themselves to address their own specific needs.
- Different methods provide different perspectives on risk. You will need to use a mix of methods and approaches to provide you with the best possible view of the risks you face.

## Understand the risks you face and how to manage them
- Use your chosen approach to identify, analyze, assess and prioritize risks and make decisions on how you are going to manage them. For example, are you going to mitigate a risk by applying some technical or non-technical control? Are you going to accept a risk and carry on without taking any further action to mitigate it? Are you going to transfer a risk to someone else (for example by considering cyber security insurance)? Or are you going to avoid a risk by changing what you do to eliminate the chance the risk occurring?
- Ensure you are taking into consideration a wide variety in risk information, and seek out information from experts or trusted sources of information. You could also consider joining knowledge sharing partnerships within industry and government (such as the CiSP Information Sharing Platform, which allows UK organizations to share cyber threat information in a secure and confidential environment).
- Remember that if you have chosen to apply controls to manage risk, you should ensure that those controls are proportionate to the risk, usable and do not adversely affect the way the business works.

## Communicate effectively about cyber risks and cyber risk management
- Make sure that you effectively communicate your risk management approach to staff and decision makers, so that they understand how cyber security risks should be managed and to help them make decisions about them.
- Ensure that you communicate cyber risk in a way that fits in with how your organization talks about other types of risk (such as legal or financial risk).
- Make sure you use meaningful language and fully explain any risk labels or scores you use. Using meaningless or poorly communicated labels can lead to misinterpretation and misunderstanding. For example, is everyone’s interpretation of what constitutes a Medium risk the same across your organization?

## Apply and seek confidence in the controls you have chosen
- Apply the controls you’ve chosen to mitigate risk to your systems and services. The following steps in this collection may help you to apply appropriate security controls and mitigations: architecture and configuration, vulnerability management, identity and access management, data security, and logging and monitoring.
- Ensure that you understand what risks remain after you have applied the controls. Whether you are applying a set of controls that are bespoke to your organization's risks or are based on a baseline such as Cyber Essentials, it is not possible to entirely eliminate risk. The remaining risk (known as residual risk), should be understood by those responsible and accountable for the risk within your organization.
- Seek confidence that the package of mitigation measures you put in place have effectively managed the risk you identified, and consider how you will maintain that confidence as your systems are used into the future.

## Continually improve your approach to risk management
- Remember that risk management is an iterative process. Technology changes, as does the business environment and their associated threats and opportunities.
- Regularly review your risks to ensure that the ways you have decided to manage them remain effective and appropriate. In particular, you should revisit your risk assessments when something significant changes. This may be when there is a change in the threats you face, or when you change the technology used to deliver and manage a system or service, or the way you use a system changes significantly.
- You will also need to review the methods, frameworks and tools you use for risk management to ensure they continue to be effective in your business context and in the face of a continuously evolving cyber security and threat landscape.
