## Why not just move to the cloud?
> The sooner a business owner understands that one cannot outsource cyber security, the better off they will be.  While some responsibility is transferred to a cloud vendor - none bear responsibility that extends beyond a few months of subscription fees.

BCSF applies to all companies, regardless of whether or not they elect to leverage "the cloud" for production.  Business owners transfer *operational risks* to risks to vendors but do not do the same with *impacts* and *business risks*.  Examples of activities business owners cannot transfer to others are:

- Vendor assessment.
- Supply chain risk considerations.
- Compliance with terms of service and "your" responsibilities.
- Identity management and audit. 
- Data export/backup for integrity and/or egress.

> Quite often the answer is "**no**" because "cloud" products must universally adhere to these principles:



### Tabs {.tabset}
#### On-demand self-service.
On-demand self-service. A consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider.

#### Broad network access
Broad network access. Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations).

#### On-demand self-service
Resource pooling. The providerâ€™s computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand. There is a sense of location independence in that the customer generally has no control or knowledge over the exact location of the provided resources but may be able to specify location at a higher level of abstraction (e.g., country, state, or datacenter). Examples of resources include storage, processing, memory, and network bandwidth.

#### On-demand self-service
Rapid elasticity. Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward
