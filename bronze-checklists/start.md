# Checklists
BCSF provides a series of core and advanced check-lists for securing your environments.  These checklists, also known as control sets, describe activities ranging from **Asset** all the way to **Vulnerability** Management.  Before diving into checklists, be sure to review the [Learning and Training](/bronze-training/start) for critical understanding of why these controls exist and what they can do for your organization.

While it does not meet minimum standards for cyber security, it is a list that offers substantial value in risk-reduction when implemented.*](/bronze-checklists/layered-defense)
- [BCSF NIST SP 800-171 Controls *Governmentwide Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) 3 Program to standardize the way the executive branch handles unclassified information that requires protection. The CUI Program is designed to address several deficiencies in managing and protecting unclassified information to include inconsistent markings, inadequate safeguarding, and needless restrictions, both by standardizing procedures and by providing common definitions through a CUI Registry.*](/bronze-checklists/layered-defense)
- [BCSF Advanced Controls - Complete Guide *Extensive cyber security control environment. We maintain a significant set of controls common to our environments and those of our customers.  Collectively, this section informs small companies on what actions to take to meet specific policy areas.  It is highly recommended that you develop your Policies before starting on checklists.*](/bronze-checklists/bcsf-advanced-control-checklists)
