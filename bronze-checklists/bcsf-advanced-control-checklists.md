# Advanced Controls/Checklists
BCSF Advanced Controls list contains `217` checklist items that tell your organization "**what**" you can do to meet your policy objectives. They are derived from our own internal operations and those of our customers.  



## Where does this fit?
Information governance often begins with a risk assessment and develop their information security programs from there.  BCSF proposes a more actionable approach to developing a program that follows this set of milestones.

1. **Why?** Determine an high-level cyber security risk policy for your organization that informs stakeholders and vendors on why this matters to you. 
2. **Where?**  Adopt (and adapt) information security policies to your organizational needs/wants. These policies with inform where to focus control activities. 
3. **What?**  Use the checklists to select items that align control activities with your polciies. These lists inform what actions you will take as an organization to improve your posture.
4. **How?** Obtain implementaiton guideance from our team on how to implement the controls in a way that brings value and fits your needs.

> When faced with a control item that seems daunting, consider the impacts if you avoided the risk alltogether. Sometimes stopping an activity is the best option. 
{.is-info}

> Every implemented control mitigates risks by some margin. Collectively, **all implemented controls meet the *minimum* standards for information security**. Focus on high-risk areas first.
