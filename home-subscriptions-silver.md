# What is a thread landscape?
Before investing in defenses, many organizations often want concrete evidence that they are, or will be targeted, by specific threats. Unfortunately, in cyberspace it is often difficult to provide an accurate assessment of the threats that specific organizations face.

However, every organization is a potential victim. All organizations have something of value that is worth something to others. If you openly demonstrate weaknesses in your approach to cyber security by failing to do the basics, you will experience some form of cyber attack.

# What specific things can you do?
In the [Core Training](/bronze-training) sections you have spent your time learning about risk management, governance, policies and key processes that help your comapny establish a minimum standard for cyber security and cyber resilience,  This access level takes a more pragmatic approach and puts your organization on direct path to meeting those standards. 

There are effective and affordable ways to reduce your organization’s exposure to the more common types of cyber attack on systems that are exposed to the Internet.

- **boundary firewalls and internet gateways** - establish network perimeter defenses, particularly web proxy, web filtering, content checking, and firewall policies to detect and block executable downloads, block access to known malicious domains and prevent users’ computers from communicating directly with the Internet
- **malware protection** - establish and maintain malware defenses to detect and respond to known attack code
- **patch management** - patch known vulnerabilities with the latest version of the software, to prevent attacks which exploit software bugs
- **whitelisting and execution control** - prevent unknown software from being able to run or install itself, including AutoRun on USB and CD drives
- **secure configuration** - restrict the functionality of every device, operating system and application to the minimum needed for business to function
- **password policy **- ensure that an appropriate password policy is in place and followed
- **user access control** - include limiting normal users’ execution permissions and enforcing the principle of least privilege

If your organization is likely to be targeted by a more technically capable attacker, give yourself greater confidence by putting in place these additional controls set out in the 10 Steps to Cyber Security:

- **security monitoring** - to identify any unexpected or suspicious activity
- **user training education and awareness** - staff should understand their role in keeping your organization secure and report any unusual activity
- **security incident management** - put plans in place to deal with an attack as an effective response will reduce the impact on your business

# Raising your cyber defenses
The Internet can be a hostile environment. The threat of attack is ever present as new vulnerabilities are released and commodity tools are produced to exploit them. Doing nothing is no longer an option. Protect your organization and your reputation by establishing some basic cyber defenses to ensure that your name is not added to the growing list of victims.
