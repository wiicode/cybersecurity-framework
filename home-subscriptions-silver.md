> The Internet can be a hostile environment. The threat of attack is ever present as new vulnerabilities are released and commodity tools are produced to exploit them. Doing nothing is no longer an option. Protect your organization and your reputation by establishing some basic cyber defenses to ensure that your name is not added to the growing list of victims.

Before investing in defenses, many organizations often want concrete evidence that they are, or will be targeted, by specific threats. Unfortunately, in cyberspace it is often difficult to provide an accurate assessment of the threats that specific organizations face.

However, every organization is a potential victim. All organizations have something of value that is worth something to others. If you openly demonstrate weaknesses in your approach to cyber security by failing to do the basics, you will experience some form of cyber attack.

# Next Phase: Looking Outward
In the [Core Training](/bronze-training) sections you have spent your time learning about risk management, governance, policies and key processes that help your comapny establish a minimum standard for cyber security and cyber resilience,  This access level takes a more pragmatic approach and puts your organization on direct path to meeting those standards. 

In the [Core Controls](/bronze-controls) section you became familiar with specific actionable steps to take in an effort to improve your organization's resiliency. 

At this stage you are ready to look beyond the internal operations and consider more developed implementations for:

- **cloud application oversight** - deep focus on the security and trust of your SaaS (cloud) based applications.  
- **user training education and awareness** - staff should understand their role in keeping your organization secure and report any unusual activity
