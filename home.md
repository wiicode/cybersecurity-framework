# Hello!
The objective behind **Bento Cyber Security Framework (BCSF)** is to promote realistic and practical controls against common threats to organizational infrastructure. BCSF will help you create an information security program that is based on standards and adapts to your organization's needs.  **BENTO:GUIDES** is the tool for learning about, developing, and maintaining your *BCSF-based* information security program. The tool gives you access to a collection of materials which you can use to build your own program. 

> **Why?** 60% of small businesses that are victims of a cyber attack go out of business within six months. Business owners are responsible for cybersecurity. Information security is complicated and dynamic. An internally developed and implemented cybersecurity program is your company's best risk mitigation and management strategy.
