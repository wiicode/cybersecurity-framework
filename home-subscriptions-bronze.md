# What is cyber security?

Cyber Security is the protection of devices, services and networks - and the information on them - from theft or damage via electronic means.  Cyber security's core function is to protect the **devices** we all use (smartphones, laptops, tablets and computers), and the **services** we access - both online and at work - from theft or damage. It's also about preventing unauthorized access to the vast amounts of **personal information** we store on these devices, and online.

# This will seem overwhelming, we know this.

> You made it this far: you are interested in doing better.  Right away you may ask yourself: how can all this represent the bare minimum?  To begin answering this question you need to embrace transformation and change.  
> {.is-success}

Main thing to understand is that today's definition of security has little to do with permission, passwords, malware, and hackers.  You - or others in your organization - are probably used to thinking making a system secure is installing a firewall or some anti-malware.  Security is a balance of convenience and control in all facets of your organization. Security is concerned with all things related to the **confidentiality** of information, **integrity** of data, and the **availability** of systems. 

You are a custodian of data that can cause a client, an employee, or a vendor to have a “bad time”. Security events are manageable risks which can lead to your buiness losing money, or worse. Your employees can lose jobs. Your clients can suffer a little, or a lot. Your vendors can suffer a little, or a lot. You matter. Your company matters. Your cybersecurity matters.

Your cybersecurity is also your problem.  While you can hire vendors to help protect systems and buy insurance to offload some of the weight, you cannot do either well unless you - the owner, the executive team, or the board - establish some form of cybersecurity strategy and do your own risk management, Good cyber security protects that ability to function, and ensures organizations can exploit the opportunities that technology brings. Cyber security is therefore central to a company's health and resilience, much like financial security, personnel security, and future security.

You are also likely thinking that this is too complicated, or feel powerless, or simply suffer from deniaism.  Perhaps these thoughts will help you:

| **Cyber-security is complex, I won't understand it.** | **You don't need to be a technical expert to make an informed cyber security decision.**<br><br>We all make security decisions every day (whether to put the alarm on, for example) without necessarily knowing how the alarm works. Boards regularly make financial or risk decisions without needing to know the details of every account or invoice. The Board should rely on its cyber security experts to provide **insight**, so that **the Board** can make informed decisions about cyber security. |
| **Cyber-attacks are sophisticated, I can't do anything to stop them.** | **Taking a methodical approach to cyber security and enacting relatively small changes can greatly reduce the risk to your organization.**<br><br>The vast majority of attacks are still based upon well known techniques (such as phishing emails) which can be defended against. Some threats can be very sophisticated, using advanced methods to break into extremely well defended networks, but we normally only see that level of commitment and expertise in attacks by nation states. Most organisations are unlikely to be a target for a sustained effort of this type, and even those that are will find that even the most sophisticated attacker will start with the simplest and cheapest option, so as not to expose their advanced methods. |
| **Cyber-attacks are targeted, I'm not at risk.** | **Many cyber attacks are opportunistic and any organization could be impacted by these un-targeted attacks.** <br><br>The majority of cyber attacks are un-targeted and opportunistic in nature, with the attacker hoping to take advantage of a weakness (or vulnerability) in a system, without any regard for who that system belongs to. These can be just as damaging as targeted attacks; the impact of WannaCry on global organisations - from shipping to the NHS - being a good example. If you’re connected to the internet then you are exposed to this risk. This trend of un-targeted attacks is unlikely to change because every organization - including yours - will have value to an attacker, even if that is simply the money you might pay in a ransomware attack. |

# What should I be doing?

Having a basic understanding of cyber security can help you to ask the right questions to seek assurance about your organization’s cyber resilience  - just as you would need to have a certain level of understanding of finance to assess the financial health of your organization. A good place to begin is to discuss your existing cyber security measures with your experts and identify what constitutes 'good' cyber security in terms of assessing your organization's cyber security measures. 

**BENTO:GUIDES** is here to help you in three ways:

1.  Provides a framework for cyber security.
2.  Provides guides and materials for understanding all aspects of the framework.
3.  Provides detailed recommendations for implementing your cybersecurity program.

With sufficient understanding and the right relationships, you can put in place defenses that will protect your critical assets against the biggest threats. Implementing good cyber security measures is not only a key part of meeting your regulatory requirements but will also help reduce the likelihood of a significant incident. Implementing even very basic cyber security controls will help reduce the chance of an incident. 

# What support can the BCSF provide on cyber security?

The BCSF Team provides cyber security guidance to small companies and supports the methods for implementing information security programs.  

-   **understands** cyber security, and summarizes this knowledge into practical guidance that we make available to all
-   **responds** to cyber security incidents to reduce the harm they cause to organisations
-   **connects** organizations with cyber security services providers

Cyber security researchers can generally find 359 ways to compromise your systems, but not all will work for your business.  BCSF encourages companies delop their own materials rather than outousrce that responsibility to tools and subscriptions.  With that said, a subscription may be part of your program, but it should not be the whole process.  A successful program often includes:

- Policies and Procedures training during onboarding and annually.
- Regular team meetings where cyber security is given 1-5 minutes.
- Case studies and stories of compromise for review.
- Security Awareness testing. 
- Insider threat detection. 
- Auditing and control validation. 


# How do feelings affect cybersecurity?
> Until machines become sentient and aware, it is ultimately people who make cybersecurity work. Cybersecurity thrives in trickle-down economics. Business leaders set the expectations, and are responsible for nurturning a culture that supports cybersecurity all the way down to the bottom. 
{.is-info}

## People's Attitudes
> Humans are the primary vulnerability in majority of the scams and hacks that affect today’s small business. It is important to understand that, despite the plethora of vulnerabilities and exploits available to attackers, the ones that are low-effort and high-reward are the greatest threat to a business. Passwords, attachments, and links are the lowest-effort means of exploitation, and all are at full control and discretion of the people working for the organization. Whether it is through human error or willful acts, humans factors are the of greatest concern in cybersecurity.
{.is-danger}

There are also five hazardous attitudes which contribute to the general vulnerabilities staff, managers, and owners. Like most things in security, or even human nature, they are not binary and exist on spectrums. All present a threat an organization and they are: impulsivity, invulnerability, machismo, resignation, and anti-authority.

### Tabs {.tabset}
#### Impulsivity

Impulsivity is attributed to heavy workloads and due to the general demand competitive work environments. Often, staff are attempting to get work done quickly. In the flurry of activity they can easily can mis-click, misread, or misinterpret an obvious threat or dismiss it after it had been triggered.

#### Invulnerability

Invulnerability is mostly associated with managers, or owners, and represents the false assumption that they are too small, too insignificant, or too simple to be a targeted. Such individuals often have fast, or direct, responses to security concerns and have taken basic measures to protect systems. The incomplete understanding of the cybersecurity landscape leads to profound gaps in the security process for the organization and general shortsightedness.

#### Machismo

Machismo is a compliment to invulnerability and also is a quality of managers and owners. Generally, it is associated with lack of sufficient understanding of security and threat management technologies, and thus fail to see the inadequacies of such controls. Suggesting that the mere presence of a firewall is sufficient to protect a system is an example.

#### Resignation

Resignation can vary with roles and is the effective surrender to threats. For managers, resignation is choosing not to do the work necessary to prevent incidents or transferring the responsibility for dealing with an incident to someone else instead of managing it. For staff, it is failing to learn safe computing practices, take training seriously, or act thoughtfully when faced with an incident.

#### Anti-authority

Anti-authority is a non-conformist approach to cybersecurity. Despite being connected to the same internet, using similar hardware, working with the same software as most organizations around the world, anti-authoritarian managers and owners chose to avoid the work, fail to comply with standards, ignore education opportunities. Such individuals continue to conduct business as they always have and have not yet come to terms that the current cybersecurity needs.
Traits.

## Responses to Attitudes
> Technology cannot fix culture or human error, at best it can help to mitigate it. Successful cybersecurity comes from within the individuals that work for your organization, and their relationship with you and your data security team. Research has shown, however, that there are key qualities beneficial to minimizing security risks and include: integrity, depth of knowledge, compliance, questioning attitude, and formality in communication. The people doing the work carrying your business forward are the best line of defense. As much as staff need awareness training, education, standards, policies, guidelines, and procedures they become exponentially more valuable to cybersecurity when they have a developed these traits.
{.is-success}

### Tabs {.tabset}

#### Curiosity

A questioning attitude is likely the most difficult trait to develop, but it is also the one that carries the greatest benefit. If people  listen to their internal alarm bells, search for the causes, and then take corrective action, the chances that they’ll forestall problems rise dramatically.

#### Integrity

Integrity is the deeply internalized ideal that leads people, without exception, to eliminate “sins of commission” (deliberate departures from protocol) and own up immediately to mistakes. Integrity is dependent on a culture that rewards honesty and offers consequences for lack thereof.

#### Education

Depth of knowledge is the result of proper education. Staff with thoroughly understand all aspects of a system—including the way it’s engineered, its vulnerabilities, and the procedures required to operate it—more readily recognize when something is wrong and handle any anomaly more effectively.

#### Methodolgy 

Procedural compliance is about knowing—or knowing where to find—proper operational procedures and to follow them to the letter. They’re also expected to recognize when a situation has eclipsed existing written procedures and new ones are called for.

#### Mindfulness

Having good judgement is a quality that any hiring manager ought to demand.  Wether your job is spent refilling vending machines or sending rockets to Mars, there is no substitue for making good choices in the moment. Encouraging mindfulness in every team is essential to cyber securiity.
