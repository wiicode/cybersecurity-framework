# Introduction
Bento Cyber Security Framework (BCSF) is an information sercurity governance framework developed for small companies. Based on international standards, this framework combines guidence with actionable processes. It is designed to offer as-is adoptable governance and expandable modules for customization. While BCSF offers granular methods for cyber security, it does not impose requirements in depth or breadth. Thus, organizations that choose to adopt BCSF may do so in pieces under a concept known as *best-effort*.
