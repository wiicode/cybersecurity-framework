# About
Your company has elected to use OneDrive & SharePoint to store company data, great!  The hard part is establishing policies and procedures and we have you covered.  This guide is directly linked from BCSF v1.0 (Bento Cyber Security Framework 1.0) and details our model for using SharePoint in Small Business.  Governance over your data is necessary and making assumptions or failing to develop understanding of how these systems work will leave you vulnerable.  In BCSF we condensed the SharePoint operating requirements to a simple model that works.

# OneDrive Business Personal

## What are they?	
OneDrive Business, Personal Folders, are your data. Company data should be stored in those folders at all times. The primary function of this folder is to act as a cloud copy of your work files. They work similarly to the non-shared AeroFS folders but are stored in a location that is mutually exclusive of the shared Team Folders.

## How will they be migrated?	
Personal folders must be migrated manually by you - the end user. After all, they are your personal files. Although the company can acquire access to these folders, they are private and we make no efforts to do so under normal circumstances.

After installing and configuring your OneDrive application, the recommendation is that you move your personal folders to your "OneDrive - <COMPANY>" folder. Copying can result in disk exhaustion or induce confusion.

## What can I expect?	
After you move your personal folders it may take a while for OneDrive to catchup. 

## What do I need to know about sharing?	
You can share files from your OneDrive Business, Personal Folders, with team members. We locked down sharing to prevent external sharing as a security measure, thus you cannot send files to people outside. For that, we offer a special site described further down in this article. In practice, however, strongly advise against sharing personal folders and leveraging Team Sites as much as possible. The use of personal sharing can become confusing and difficult to manage.
