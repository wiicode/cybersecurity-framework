# Layered Defense
The current version of Bento Cyber Security Framework suggests small companies focus on a sound **Layered Defense** strategy while being aware for the increasing need to adopt **Zero Trust Architecture**. The recommendation is to build layered defenses around systems and application swhile increasingly demanding that third-party vendors and SaaS providers practice **ZTA** allowing for incremental improvements and adoption.

Layered Defense breaks information security into seven key areas and attempts to guide an organization into building a strategy that protects each layer.  Any system, person, or application granted access into a layer is allowed to perform operations in that layer.  For example, an office worker allowed into a space can use a comptuer avaialble in that space.

Zero Trust Architecture is a thread model where every action requires validation. Going back to the office worker example above, theoretically that employee would need to receive approval every step of the way.  While that may not work on humans, it is quickly becomin the standard for applications/systems/code.
