<p>Bento Cyber Security Framework Attestation (BENTO:AUDIT) is a service that assists organizations in protecting their key<i> </i>cyber assets. It was developed by cybersecurity experts with support from CISA. The process provides organizations with a systematic and repeatable approach to assessing the security posture of their cyber systems and networks. It includes both high-level and detailed questions related to all industrial control and IT systems.</p>
<h2><strong>Purpose</strong></h2>
<p>BENTO:AUDIT is a service for performing cybersecurity assessments of an organization's enterprise and industrial control cyber systems. It was designed to help asset owners identify vulnerabilities and improve the organization's overall cybersecurity posture by guiding them through a series of questions that represent network security requirements and best practices. The presented requirement questionnaires are based on selected industry standards, common requirements, and the network diagram (or network topology and architecture). The resulting BENTO:AUDIT:REPORT&nbsp;is a prioritized list of recommendations for improving the cybersecurity posture of the organization's enterprise and industrial control cyber systems. The process derives the recommendations from a database of cybersecurity standards, guidelines, and practices.</p>
<p>BENTO:AUDIT incorporates a variety of available standards from organizations such as NIST, North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), Transportation Security Administration (TSA), U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), and others. &nbsp;During scoping an appropriate standard is selected and an interview process is used to evaluate an organization's posture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The interviews take between 4 hours and 160 hours depending on the size of the organization and assessment used.&nbsp;</p>
