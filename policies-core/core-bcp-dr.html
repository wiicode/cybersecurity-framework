  <li>Financial consideration</li>

<p>A dedicated disaster recovery functional team shall be established for the management and implementation of the DR plan.</p>
<h3>4.5 Exercising/Testing</h3>
<p>Periodic tests shall be performed by designated personnel authorized by {{organization.name}}’s management to test the execution of business continuity and disaster recovery plans through:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Conducting disaster role-playing (“table-top”) sessions that allow participants to “walk through” the facets of the BCP, gaining familiarity with their responsibilities given a specific emergency scenario(s).</li>
  <li>Perform a simulation of a possible disaster scenario with different realistic scenarios that test the effectiveness of BCP.</li>
  <li>Wherever possible, accommodate any work stoppages due to the real testing of the BCP and DRP by appropriately scheduling simulations and other testing exercises.</li>
</ul>
<p>After the completion of the business continuity and disaster recovery plans test, an assessment report shall be created that clearly indicates whether the exercise/test was successful or not including corrective actions. Documented plans shall be updated based on the results of the tests performed.</p>
