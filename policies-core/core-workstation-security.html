<h1 style="text-align:center;"><strong>Workstation Security Policy</strong></h1>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h2><strong>1.0 Purpose&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>The purpose of this policy is to provide guidance for security for {{organization.name}} workstations in order to ensure the security of information on the workstation and information the workstation may have access to.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>2.0 Scope&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>This policy applies to all &nbsp;{{organization.name}} employees, contractors, workforce members, vendors and agents with &nbsp;{{organization.name}}-owned or personal workstations connected to the &nbsp;{{organization.name}} network.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>3.0 Definitions&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>Workstations include&nbsp;laptops, desktops, tablets, phones, PDAs, computer-based equipment containing or accessing customer information and authorized home workstations accessing the &nbsp;{{organization.name}} network.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>4.0 Policy&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>Appropriate measures must be taken when using workstations to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of sensitive information and that access to sensitive information is restricted to authorized users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Workforce members using workstations shall consider the sensitivity of the information that may be accessed and minimize the possibility of unauthorized access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;{{organization.name}} will implement physical and technical safeguards to restrict access to authorized users for all workstations that access electronically protected customer information.</p>
<p>The following procedures shall be in force to manage technical, physical and administrative controls and safeguards for &nbsp;{{organization.name}} workstations:</p>
<h3><strong>4.1 Physical Safeguards</strong></h3>
<p>Physical access to workstations shall be restricted to authorized personnel only. Employees shall prevent unauthorized viewing of information on a screen by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Securing workstations (screen lock or logout) prior to leaving the area to prevent unauthorized access.</li>
  <li>Enabling a password-protected screen saver with a short timeout period to ensure that workstations that were left unsecured will be protected.</li>
  <li>Ensuring workstations are used for authorized business purposes only.</li>
  <li>Keeping food and drink away from workstations in order to avoid accidental spills.</li>
  <li>Securing laptops that contain sensitive information by using cable locks or locking laptops up in drawers or cabinets.</li>
  <li>Ensuring that screens/monitors are positioned away from public view. If necessary, install privacy screen filters or other physical barriers to public viewing.</li>
  <li>Enabling lockout after 30 minutes of inactivity.</li>
  <li>Complying with all applicable password policies and procedures.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>4.2 Operational Safeguards</strong></h3>
<p>Employees shall use workstations for authorized business purposes only and only approved personnel may install software on workstations. The following operational safeguards shall be implemented:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ensuring that the latest OS and software updates are installed.</li>
  <li>Never install unauthorized software on workstations.</li>
  <li>Storing all sensitive information on network servers.</li>
  <li>Ensuring that workstations use a surge protector (not just a power strip) or a UPS (battery backup).</li>
  <li>If wireless network access is used, ensure access is secure by using the highest generally accepted wireless security encryption standard (i.e. WPA2, etc.).</li>
  <li>Install and enable security features such as firewalls, anti-virus and anti-malware software.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>4.3 Management and Administration&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>The Information Technology department shall ensure that workstations have all critical security updates patched and installed in a timely manner.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>5.0 Enforcement&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>Any employee found to have violated this policy may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.</p>
