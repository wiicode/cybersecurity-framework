<h1>Step 1 - Backing up your data</h1>
<p style="text-align:center;"><mark class="marker-yellow">5 things to consider when backing up your data.</mark></p>
<p>Think about how much you rely on your business-critical data, such as customer details, quotes, orders, and payment details. Now imagine how long you would be able to operate without them.</p>
<p>All businesses, regardless of size, should take regular backups of their important data, and make sure that these backups are recent and can be restored. By doing this, you're ensuring your business can still function following the impact of flood, fire, physical damage or theft. Furthermore, if you have backups of your data that you can quickly recover, you can't be blackmailed by ransomware attacks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Tip 1: Identify what data you need to back up</h3>
<p>Your first step is to identify your essential data. That is, the information that your business couldn't function without. Normally this will comprise documents, photos, emails, contacts, and calendars, most of which are kept in just a few common folders on your computer, phone, tablet or network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Tip 2: Keep your backup separate from your computer</h3>
<p>Whether it's on a USB stick, on a separate drive or a separate computer, access to data backups should be restricted so that they:</p>
<ul>
  <li>are not accessible by staff</li>
  <li>are not permanently connected (either physically or over a local network) to the device holding the original copy</li>
</ul>
<p>Ransomware (and other malware) can often move to attached storage automatically, which means any such backup could also be infected, leaving you with no backup to recover from. For more resilience, you should consider storing your backups in a different location, so fire or theft won't result in you losing both copies. Cloud storage solutions (see below) are a cost-effective and efficient way of achieving this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Tip 3: Consider the cloud</h3>
<p>You've probably already used cloud storage during your everyday work and personal life without even knowing - unless you're running your own email server, your emails are already stored 'in the cloud'.</p>
<p>Using cloud storage (where a service provider stores your data on their infrastructure) means your data is physically separate from your location. You'll also benefit from a high level of availability. Service providers can supply your organisation with data storage and web services without you needing to invest in expensive hardware up front. Most providers offer a limited amount of storage space for free, and larger storage capacity for minimal costs to small businesses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Tip 4: Read our cloud security guidance</h3>
<p>Not all service providers are the same, but the market is reasonably mature and most providers have good security practices built-in. By handing over significant parts of your IT services to a service provider, you'll benefit from specialist expertise that smaller organisations would perhaps struggle to justify in terms of cost. However, before contacting service providers, we encourage you to read the NCSC's Cloud Security Guidance. This guidance will help you decide what to look for when evaluating their services, and what they can offer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Tip 5: Make backing up part of your everyday business</h3>
<p>We know that backing up is not a very interesting thing to do (and there will always be more important tasks that you feel should take priority), but the majority of network or cloud storage solutions now allow you to make backups automatically. For instance, when new files of a certain type are saved to specified folders. Using automated backups not only saves time, but also ensures that you have the latest version of your files should you need them.</p>
<p>Many off-the-shelf backup solutions are easy to set up, and are affordable considering the business-critical protection they offer. When choosing a solution, you'll also have to consider how much data you need to back up, and how quickly you need to be able to access the data following any incident.</p>
<h1>Step 2 - Protecting your organisation from malware</h1>
<p>5 free and easy-to-implement tips that can help prevent malware damaging your organisation.</p>
<p>Malicious software (also known as 'malware') is software or web content that can harm your organisation, such as the recent <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/WannaCry-guidance-for-home-users-and-small-businesses">WannaCry outbreak</a>. The most well-known form of malware is viruses, which are self-copying programs that infect legitimate software.</p>
<p>This section contains 5 free and easy-to-implement tips that can help prevent malware damaging your organisation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Tip 1: Install (and turn on) antivirus software</h3>
<p>Antivirus software - which is often included for free within popular operating systems - should be used on all computers and laptops. For your office equipment, you can pretty much click 'enable', and you're instantly safer. Smartphones and tablets might require a different approach and if configured in accordance with the NCSC's EUD guidance, separate antivirus software might not be necessary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Tip 2: Prevent staff from downloading dodgy apps</h3>
<p>You should only download apps for mobile phones and tablets from manufacturer-approved stores (like Google Play or Apple App Store). These apps are checked to provide a certain level of protection from malware that might cause harm. You should prevent staff from downloading third party apps from unknown vendors/sources, as these will not have been checked.</p>
<p>Staff accounts should only have enough access required to perform their role, with extra permissions (i.e. for administrators) only given to those who need it.&nbsp; When administrative accounts are created, they should only be used for that specific task, with standard user accounts used for general work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Tip 3: Keep all your IT equipment up to date (patching)</h3>
<p>For all your IT equipment (so tablets, smartphones, laptops and PCs), make sure that the software and firmware is always kept up to date with the latest versions from software developers, hardware suppliers and vendors. Applying these updates (a process known as patching) is one of the most important things you can do to improve security - the IT version of eating your fruit and veg. Operating systems, programmes, phones and apps should all be set to 'automatically update' wherever this is an option.</p>
<p>At some point, these updates will no longer be available (as the product reaches the end of its supported life), at which point you should consider replacing it with a modern alternative. For more information on applying updates, refer to the <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/vulnerability-management">NCSC's guidance on Vulnerability Management</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Tip 4: Control how USB drives (and memory cards) can be used</h3>
<p>We all know how tempting it is to use USB drives or memory cards to transfer files between organisations and people. However, it only takes a single cavalier user to inadvertently plug in an infected stick (such as a USB drive containing malware) to devastate the whole organisation.</p>
<p>When drives and cards are openly shared, it becomes hard to track what they contain, where they've been, and who has used them. You can reduce the likelihood of infection by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>blocking access to physical ports for most users</li>
  <li>using antivirus tools</li>
  <li>only allowing approved drives and cards to be used within your organisation - and nowhere else</li>
</ul>
<p>Make these directives part of your company policy to prevent your organisation being exposed to unnecessary risks. You can also ask staff to transfer files using alternative means (such as by email or cloud storage), rather than via USB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Tip 5: Switch on your firewall</h3>
<p>Firewalls create a 'buffer zone' between your own network and external networks (such as the Internet). Most popular operating systems now include a firewall, so it may simply be a case of switching this on. For more detailed information on using firewalls, refer to the <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/10-steps-to-cyber-security/the-10-steps/network-security">Network Security section of the NCSC's 10 Steps to Cyber Security</a>.</p>
<h1>Step 3 - Keeping your smartphones (and tablets) safe</h1>
<p>5 quick tips that can help keep your mobile devices (and the information stored on them) secure.</p>
<p>Mobile technology is now an essential part of modern business, with more of our data being stored on tablets and smartphones. What's more, these devices are now as powerful as traditional computers, and because they often leave the safety of the office (and home), they need even more protection than 'desktop' equipment.</p>
<p>With this in mind, here are 5 quick tips that can help keep your mobile devices (and the information stored on them) secure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Tip 1: Switch on password protection</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/three-random-words-or-thinkrandom-0">A suitably complex PIN or password</a> (opposed to a simple one that can be easily guessed or gleaned from your social media profiles) will prevent the average criminal from accessing your phone. Many devices now include fingerprint recognition to lock your device, without the need for a password. However, these features are not always enabled 'out of the box', so you should always check they have been switched on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Tip 2: Make sure lost or stolen devices can be tracked, locked or wiped</h3>
<p>Staff are more likely to have their tablets or phones stolen (or lose them) when they are away from the office or home. Fortunately, the majority of devices include free web-based tools that are invaluable should you lose your device. You can use them to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>track the location of a device</li>
  <li>remotely lock access to the device (to prevent anyone else using it)</li>
  <li>remotely erase the data stored on the device</li>
  <li>retrieve a backup of data stored on the device</li>
</ul>
<p>Setting up these tools on all your organisation's devices may seem daunting at first, but by using <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/ncsc-it-mdm-products-which-one-best-1">mobile device management software</a>, you can set up your devices to a standard configuration with a single click.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Tip 3: Keep your device up to date</h3>
<p>No matter what phones or tablets your organisation is using, it is important that they are kept up to date at all times. All manufacturers (for example Windows, Android, iOS) release regular updates that contain critical security updates to keep the device protected. This process is quick, easy, and free; devices should be set to automatically update, where possible. Make sure your staff know how important these updates are, and explain how to do it, if necessary. At some point, these updates will no longer be available (as the device reaches the end of its supported life), at which point you should consider replacing it with a modern alternative.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Tip 4: Keep your apps up to date</h3>
<p>Just like the operating systems on your organisation's devices, all the applications that you have installed should also be updated regularly with patches from the software developers. These updates will not only add new features, but they will also patch any security holes that have been discovered. Make sure staff know when updates are ready, how to install them, and that it's important to do so straight away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Tip 5: Don't connect to unknown Wi-Fi Hotspots</h3>
<p>When you use public Wi-Fi hotspots (for example in hotels or coffee shops), there is no way to easily find out who controls the hotspot, or to prove that it belongs to who you think it does. If you connect to these hotspots, somebody else could access:</p>
<ul>
  <li>what you're working on whilst connected</li>
  <li>your private login details that many apps and web services maintain whilst you're logged on</li>
</ul>
<p>The simplest precaution is not to connect to the Internet using unknown hotspots, and instead use your mobile 3G or 4G mobile network, which will have built-in security. This means you can also use 'tethering' (where your other devices such as laptops share your 3G/4G connection), or a wireless 'dongle' provided by your mobile network. You can also use Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), a technique that encrypts your data before it is sent across the Internet. If you're using third party VPNs, you'll need the technical ability to configure it yourself, and should only use VPNs provided by reputable service providers.</p>
<h1>Step 4 - Using passwords to protect your data</h1>
<p>5 things to keep in mind when using passwords.</p>
<p>Your laptops, computers, tablets and smartphones will contain a lot of your own business-critical data, the personal information of your customers, and also details of the online accounts that you access. It is essential that this data is available to you, but not available to unauthorised users.</p>
<p>Passwords - when implemented correctly - are a free, easy and effective way to prevent unauthorised users accessing your devices. This section outlines 5 things to keep in mind when using passwords.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Tip 1: Make sure you switch on password protection</h3>
<p>Set a screenlock password, PIN, or other authentication method (such as fingerprint or face unlock). The NCSC blog has some good advice on passwords. If you’re mostly using fingerprint or face unlock, you’ll be entering a password less often, so consider setting up a long password that’s difficult to guess.</p>
<p>Having said this, password protection is not just for smartphones and tablets. Make sure that your office equipment (so laptops and PCs) all use an encryption product (such as BitLocker for Windows) using a <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc766295(v=ws.10).aspx">Trusted Platform Module (TPM</a>) with a PIN, or <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204837">FileVault</a> (on macOS) in order to start up. Most modern devices have encryption built in, but encryption may still need to be turned on and configured, so check you have set it up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Tip 2: Use two-factor authentication for 'important' accounts</h3>
<p>If you’re given the option to use two-factor authentication (also known as 2FA) for any of your accounts, you should do; it adds a large amount of security for not much extra effort. 2FA requires two different methods to 'prove' your identity before you can use a service, generally a password plus one other method. This could be a code that's sent to your smartphone (or a code that's generated from a bank's card reader) that you must enter in addition to your password.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Tip 3: Avoid using predictable passwords</h3>
<p>If you are in charge of IT policies within your organisation, make sure staff are <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/top-tips-for-staying-secure-online/use-a-strong-and-separate-password-for-email">given actionable information</a> on setting passwords that is easy for them to understand.</p>
<p>Passwords should be easy to remember, but hard for somebody else to guess. A good rule is 'make sure that somebody who knows you well, couldn't guess your password in 20 attempts'. Staff should also avoid using the <a href="https://www.teamsid.com/worst-passwords-2015/">most common passwords</a>, which criminals can easily guess. The NCSC has some useful advice on <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/three-random-words-or-thinkrandom-0">how to choose a non-predictable password</a>.</p>
<p>Remember that your IT systems should not require staff to share accounts or passwords to get their job done. Make sure that every user has personal access to the right systems, and that the level of access given is always the lowest needed to do their job, whilst minimising unnecessary exposure to systems they don't need access to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Tip 4: Help your staff cope with 'password overload'</h3>
<p>If you're in charge of how passwords are used in your organisation, there's a number of things you can do that will improve security. Most importantly, your staff will have dozens of non-work related passwords to remember as well, so only enforce password access to a service if you really need to. Where you do use passwords to access a service, do not enforce regular password changes. Passwords really only need to be changed when you suspect a compromise of the login credentials.</p>
<p>You should also provide secure storage so staff can write down passwords for important accounts (such as email and banking), and keep them safe (but not with the device itself). Staff will forget passwords, so make sure they can reset their own passwords easily.</p>
<p>Consider using password managers, which are tools that can create and store passwords for you that you access via a 'master' password. Since the master password is protecting all of your other passwords, make sure it’s a strong one, for example by using <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/three-random-words-or-thinkrandom-0">three random words</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Tip 5: Change all default passwords</h3>
<p>One of the most common mistakes is not changing the manufacturers' default passwords that smartphones, laptops, and other types of equipment are issued with. Change all default passwords before devices are distributed to staff. You should also regularly check devices (and software) specifically to detect unchanged default passwords</p>
<h1>Step 5 - Avoiding phishing attacks&nbsp;</h1>
<p>Attackers use publicly available information about your organisation and staff to make their phishing messages more convincing. This is often gleaned from your website and social media accounts (information known as a 'digital footprint').</p>
<p>Understand the impact of information shared on your organisation's website and social media pages. What do visitors to your website need to know, and what detail is unnecessary (but could be useful for attackers)?</p>
<p>Be aware of what your partners, contractors and suppliers give away about your organisation online.</p>
<p>Help your staff understand how sharing their personal information can affect them and your organisation. This is not about expecting people to remove all traces of themselves from the Internet. Instead support them as they manage their digital footprint, shaping their profile so that it works for them and the organisation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cpni.gov.uk/my-digital-footprint">CPNI’s Digital Footprint Campaign</a> contains a range of useful materials (including posters and booklets) to help organisations work with employees to minimise online security risks.</p>
