## Appendix 1: Cyber security regulation

The regulation summarised below outlines the need for organisations to demonstrate and implement cyber security standards. The NCSC has contributed to the setting of cyber security standards to ensure they reflect good cyber security practice. By following and implementing NCSC guidance, organisations will be 'on their way' to meeting the cyber security requirements regulation.  

### **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**

The GDPR requires that personal data must be processed securely using appropriate technical and organisational measures. The Regulation does not mandate a specific set of cyber security measures, but rather expects you to take ‘appropriate’ action. In other words you need to [manage risk](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/board-toolkit?curPage=/collection/board-toolkit/risk-management-for-cyber-security). What is appropriate for you will depend upon your circumstances, as well as the data you are processing and therefore the risks posed.

However, there is an expectation you have minimal, established security measures in place. The security measures must be designed into your systems at the outset (referred to as Privacy by Design) and maintained effective throughout the life of your system.

The NCSC have worked with the ICO to develop a set of [GDPR Security Outcomes](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/gdpr-security-outcomes). This guidance provides an overview of what the GDPR says about security, and describes a set of security related outcomes that all organisations processing personal data should seek to achieve. 

### **Networks and Information Systems (NIS) Directive**

The NIS Directive aims to raise levels of the overall security and resilience of network and information systems across the EU. It applies to companies and organisations identified as operators of essential services (OES). The regulatory responsibilities are carried out by Competent Authorities (CAs). The criteria for identifying OES and the list of CAs in the UK can be found within the [_NIS Regulations_](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/506/contents/made).

The NCSC is providing technical support and guidance to other government departments, Devolved Adminstrations, CAs and OES through:

-   a set of [cyber security principles](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/nis-directive/cyber-assessment-framework/introduction-to-the-cyber-assessment-framework) for securing essential services
-   a collection of [supporting guidance](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/nis-directive)
-   a [Cyber Assessment Framework (CAF)](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/nis-directive/cyber-assessment-framework/introduction-to-the-cyber-assessment-framework) incorporating indicators of good practice
-   implementation guidance and support to CAs to enable them to:
    -   adapt the NCSC NIS principles for use in their sectors 
    -   plan and undertake assessments using the CAF and interpret the results

### **What is the NCSC's role in regulation?**

The NCSC is **not** a regulator. However, as the UK technical authority for cyber security, the NCSC provides support and advice to companies and regulators to help minimise the risk of incidents and respond to them effectively if/when they do occur. The NCSC looks to ensure that any requirements are in line with best practice, and that frameworks are consistent across different pieces of regulation.

The NCSC also has a role to provide support during significant incidents, and these incidents may fall under specific regulation. We will encourage victims to consider their regulatory obligations, but recognise that any regulatory reporting or co-operation must be led by the victim.

It is also important to recognise that cyber security is only one aspect of security and business practice, and so there is wider regulation (such as Foreign Direct Investment, or EU restrictions on offshoring data) that must be considered in cyber security decisions.

## Appendix 2: Help with cyber incidents

### **During an incident:**

-   If you are reporting **fraud or cyber crime**, please refer to the [**Action Fraud website**](https://www.actionfraud.police.uk/).
-   If you have been subject to a personal data breach that is required to be reported under the **GDPR**, please contact the [**ICO**](https://ico.org.uk/concerns/) (Information Commissioner's Office). If there is malicious cyber activity related to this which you wish to report (either for information or for action), please complete an the [_NCSC Incident Form_](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/reporting-cyber-security-incident).
-   If you are an Operator of Essential Services (OES) under the **NIS Directive**, please complete an [_NCSC Incident Form_](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/reporting-cyber-security-incident) in addition to reporting to your Competent Authority (CA). This is applicable for any cyber incident which you feel requires NCSC's support (for action) or is for wider interest (for information).

Note that depending on the size of your organisation and the nature of the incident, you may receive support from the NCSC, the National Crime Agency or your Regional Organised Crime Units (ROCU).

### **For ongoing support and guidance:**

The NCSC publishes all of its [_guidance_](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/section/advice-guidance/all-topics) on this website, and the [_NCSC twitter feed_](https://twitter.com/NCSC) and [_LinkedIn page_](https://www.linkedin.com/company/national-cyber-security-centre) are _g_ood ways to keep up to date with new publications. If you want to receive more targeted information and a higher classification of threat intelligence, you should join an industry group in [_CISP_](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/information/cyber-security-information-sharing-partnership--cisp-).

## Appendix 3: About the NCSC

The NCSC was set up to help protect our critical services from cyber attacks, manage major incidents, and improve the underlying security of the UK internet through technological improvement and advice to citizens and organisations. Our vision is to help make the UK the safest place to live and do business online.

The NCSC supports the most critical organisations in the UK, the wider public sector, industry, SMEs, homes and families. When incidents do occur, we provide effective incident response to minimise harm to the UK, help with recovery, and learn lessons for the future.

The NCSC is the UK government's technical authority and therefore takes the lead role in providing guidance and advice on cyber security for UK organisations. We may also work with Law Enforcement when resolving or investigating an incident, or be asked to contribute to discussions on cyber security policy by government departments such as Cabinet Office or DCMS.
