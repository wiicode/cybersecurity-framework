<h2>4.0 Policy</h2>
<p>There shall be a designated individual responsible for the establishment of information security incident management within the organization i.e overseeing incident management activities including documentation, response, escalation, resolution and analysis of incidents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>{{organization.name}} should communicate where applicable with its employees, customers and other stakeholders when an incident that impacts them occurs, provide updates during the incident and after the resolution.</p>
<p>As needed, the security incidents would be reported outside of {{organization.name}}, by a designated person nominated by senior management. Users shall not report to or discuss incidents with other users or external persons as this may affect the company’s reputation or hinder the investigation.</p>
<p>Intrusion attempts, security breaches, theft or loss of hardware, suspicion of an incident or other security related incidents perpetrated against the organization must be reported to the incident management team (See Appendix 1 for details). All known vulnerabilities - in addition to all suspected or known violations must be communicated in a timely manner.</p>
<p>The post-incident analysis must take place, as necessary, to identify the source of the incident.</p>
<p>All critical servers should be monitored to ensure that users only perform authorized actions and processes. Aspects to be monitored as relevant are audit trails, which record exceptions and other relevant events. Audit trails shall be kept for a defined period to assist in investigations and ongoing access-control monitoring.</p>
<p>Accurate computer system clocks are essential to ensure the accuracy of audit logs, which may be needed for investigations or as evidence in legal or disciplinary cases.</p>
<p>Learnings from incidents shall be incorporated into the {{organization.name}}’s the risk assessment process for continual improvements.</p>
<h3>4.1 Reporting an Incident</h3>
<p>Any breach of information security policies must be reported as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Users should immediately report all incidents pertaining to information security with the below information at a minimum:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Incident Date/Time</li>
  <li>Type of Incident</li>
  <li>Description/ Incident details</li>
  <li>Incident Location</li>
  <li>Contact Details</li>
</ul>
<h3>4.2 Handling an Incident</h3>
<p>The designated individual for handling security incidents will decide as to whether an incident needs to be “handed” over and dealt with by departmental representatives, where appropriate, or whether the incident needs to be escalated to senior management.</p>
<p>Representatives looking into security breaches will be responsible for updating, amending and modifying the status of incidents. The root cause of the incident must be analyzed for taking necessary steps to prevent a recurrence.</p>
