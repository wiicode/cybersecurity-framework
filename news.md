# Potential Legacy Risk from Malware Targeting QNAP NAS Devices
Original release date: July 27, 2020 | Last revised: August 06, 2020

This is a joint alert from the United States Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the United Kingdomâ€™s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC).

CISA and NCSC are investigating a strain of malware known as QSnatch, which attackers used in late 2019 to target Network Attached Storage (NAS) devices manufactured by the firm QNAP.  

All QNAP NAS devices are potentially vulnerable to QSnatch malware if not updated with the latest security fixes. The malware, documented in open-source reports, has infected thousands of devices worldwide with a particularly high number of infections in North America and Europe. Further, once a device has been infected, attackers can prevent administrators from successfully running firmware updates.

This alert summarizes the findings of CISA and NCSC analysis and provides mitigation advice.
