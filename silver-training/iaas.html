<p>As&nbsp;the name suggests<i>, Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</i>&nbsp;provides just one thing: Infrastructure. The platform and application stack built on top of the service architecture is generally the responsibility of you, the service user.</p>
<p>Along with the responsibility for designing and building these systems comes the need to ensure they are properly protected. And once again this duty falls to you, the service user.</p>
<p>In practice, this entails securely configuring the infrastructure you deploy and anything you build upon it.</p>
<h3><strong>Questions and answers</strong></h3>
<p>This situation throws up some questions: What do I need to secure? How secure do things need to be? How can I be sure the measures I put in place are working? The guidance set out below will help you find answers to these questions and many others related to the security of your IaaS systems.</p>
<h3><strong>A familiar methodology</strong></h3>
<p>The guidance follows a familiar pattern, addressing each of the&nbsp;Cloud Security Principles&nbsp;in turn. The aim is to equip you with the information required to make informed decisions about the security of your applications and data in an IaaS scenario.</p>
<h2>The 13 IaaS Principles</h2>
<h1>1: Data in transit protection</h1>
<p>Data transiting networks should be adequately protected against tampering and eavesdropping through a combination of network protection and encryption.</p>

          <p>For data in transit&nbsp;<strong>between your end user devices or systems and the service</strong>, consider the following options:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>use the remote access solution provided by the service (if available)</li>
            <li>build your own remote access solution using virtual security appliances</li>
            <li>deploy TLS as the primary data in transit protection for exposed interfaces from your service</li>
            <li>deploy TLS to complement the data in transit protections provided by the service</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Consider the following options to protect&nbsp;<strong>data in transit within the IaaS service</strong>:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>rely on the network separation offered by the service to protect data in transit within the service</li>
            <li>configure IPsec or TLS between compute instances</li>

          <p>The IaaS provider may be able to offer assurance that your data (disk images and other storage) is appropriately protected - physically, logically or cryptographically.</p>
          <p>Where satisfactory protection&nbsp;<i>is not provided</i>&nbsp;by the IaaS provider, or if you want additional confidence, you can implement your own encryption of the data you store. For example using volume encryption.</p>

          <p>Management of encryption keys is likely to be the biggest challenge when attempting to encrypt storage in an IaaS service. You need the keys to be readily available (for resilience reasons) but you don’t want them to be available to an attacker.</p>

          <p>The actions you need to take will depend on what the IaaS provider does for you, and the level of confidence you need that your data is no longer with the provider.</p>

          <p>In IaaS, responsibilities will be split between the IaaS provider and the user. Without clear delineation of responsibilities, there is a risk that each assumes the other is managing specific risks. It is important that information risk governance covers the whole application.</p>

<h1>5: Operational security</h1>
<p>The service provider should have processes and procedures in place to ensure the operational security of the underlying IaaS service.</p>
<p>However, you will be responsible for much of the operational security of your applications.</p>
<p>The way you manage this may differ from traditionally provisioned IT, but the risks and activities remain very similar.</p>

          <p>You should have business continuity plans in place to handle any disruptions to the cloud service. The IaaS provider may recommend good practices relating to running robust and reliable services using the constructs they make available.</p>
