<p>As needed, the security incidents would be reported outside of {{organization.name}}, by a designated person nominated by senior management. Users shall not report to or discuss incidents with other users or external persons as this may affect the company’s reputation or hinder the investigation.</p>
<p>Intrusion attempts, security breaches, theft or loss of hardware, suspicion of an incident or other security related incidents perpetrated against the organization must be reported to the incident management team (See Appendix 1 for details).

<p>Accurate computer system clocks are essential to ensure the accuracy of audit logs, which may be needed for investigations or as evidence in legal or disciplinary cases.</p>
<p>Learnings from incidents shall be incorporated into the {{organization.name}}’s the risk assessment process for continual improvements.</p>
<h3>4.1 Reporting an Incident</h3>

</ul>
<h3>4.2 Handling an Incident</h3>
<p>The established <i><strong>Cyber Incident Response (CIR) Procedures</strong></i> determine the initial steps including who should be informed and whether an incident needs to be “escalated”.</p>
