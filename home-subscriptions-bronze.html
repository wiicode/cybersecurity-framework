<h2>What is cyber security?</h2>
<p>Cyber Security is the protection of devices, services and networks - and the information on them - from&nbsp;theft or damage via electronic means.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What do I need to know about cyber security?</h2>
<p>There are three common myths concerning cyber security. Understanding why they're incorrect will help you understand some key aspects of cyber security.</p>
<p><strong>Myth #1:&nbsp;Cyber is complex, I won't understand it.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reality:&nbsp;You don't need to be a technical expert to make an informed cyber security decision.</strong></p>
<p>We all make security decisions every day (whether to put the alarm on, for example) without necessarily knowing how the alarm works. Boards regularly make financial or risk decisions without needing to know the details of every account or invoice. The Board should rely on its cyber&nbsp;security experts to provide&nbsp;<strong>insight</strong>,&nbsp;so that&nbsp;<strong>the Board</strong>&nbsp;can&nbsp;make informed decisions about cyber security.</p>
<p><strong>Myth #2:&nbsp;Cyber attacks are&nbsp;sophisticated, I can't do anything to stop them.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reality:&nbsp;Taking a methodical approach to cyber security and enacting relatively small changes can greatly reduce the risk to your organisation.</strong></p>
<p>The&nbsp;vast majority of attacks are still based upon well known&nbsp;techniques (such as phishing emails) which can be defended against.&nbsp;Some threats can be very sophisticated, using advanced methods to break into extremely well defended networks, but we normally only see that level of commitment and expertise in attacks by nation states.&nbsp;Most&nbsp;organisations are unlikely to be a target for a sustained effort of this type, and even those that are will find that even the most sophisticated attacker will start with the simplest and cheapest option, so as not to expose their&nbsp;advanced&nbsp;methods.</p>
<p><strong>Myth #3:&nbsp;Cyber attacks are targeted,&nbsp;I'm&nbsp;not at risk.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reality:&nbsp;Many cyber attacks are opportunistic and any organization could be impacted by these un-targeted attacks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The majority of cyber attacks are un-targeted and opportunistic in nature, with the attacker&nbsp;hoping to take advantage of a weakness (or&nbsp;vulnerability) in a system, without any regard for who that system belongs to. These can&nbsp;be just as damaging as targeted attacks; the impact of&nbsp;WannaCry on global organisations - from shipping to the NHS - being a good example. If you’re connected to the internet then you are exposed to this risk. This trend of un-targeted attacks is unlikely to change because every organization - including yours - will have value to an attacker, even if that is simply the&nbsp;money you might pay&nbsp;in a ransomware attack.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How do cyber attacks work?</h2>
<p>A good way to increase your understanding of cyber security is to review examples of how cyber attacks work, and what actions organisations take to mitigate them. Reviewing incidents that have occurred within your organization is a good place to start.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In general, cyber attacks have 4 stages:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Survey&nbsp;</strong>- investigating and analyzing available information about the target in order to identify potential vulnerabilities.</li>
  <li><strong>Delivery&nbsp;</strong>-&nbsp;getting to the point in a system where you have an initial foothold in the system.</li>
  <li><strong>Breach&nbsp;</strong>- exploiting the vulnerability/vulnerabilities to gain some form of unauthorized access.</li>
  <li><strong>Affect&nbsp;</strong>- carrying out activities within a system that achieve the attacker’s goal.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Defending against cyber attacks</h2>
<p>The key thing to understand about cyber security defenses is that they need to be layered and include a range of measures, from technology solutions to user education to effective policies. While entire sections are dedicated to this topic, business owners and managers can jump directly to our section on <a href="/bronze-training/board-implementations">Implementing effective cyber security measures</a>&nbsp;which provides further detail and questions that you can use to understand more about your own organization's&nbsp;defenses.</p>
<h2>What support can the BCSF provide on cyber security?</h2>
<p>The BCSF Team provides cyber security guidance to small companies and supports the methods for implementing information security programs. &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>understands</strong> cyber security, and summarizes this knowledge into&nbsp;practical&nbsp;guidance<strong>&nbsp;</strong>that we make available to all</li>
  <li><strong>responds </strong>to&nbsp;cyber security incidents&nbsp;to reduce the harm they cause to organisations&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>connects</strong> organizations with cyber security services providers</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
