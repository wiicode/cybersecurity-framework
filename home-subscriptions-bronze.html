<h1>What is cyber security?</h1>
<p>Cyber Security is the protection of devices, services and networks - and the information on them - from&nbsp;theft or damage via electronic means. &nbsp;Cyber security's core function is to protect the&nbsp;<strong>devices</strong>&nbsp;we all use (smartphones, laptops, tablets and computers), and the&nbsp;<strong>services</strong>&nbsp;we access - both online and at work - from theft or damage. It's also about preventing unauthorized access to the vast amounts of&nbsp;<strong>personal&nbsp;information</strong>&nbsp;we store on these devices, and online.</p>
<h1>This will seem overwhelming, we know this.</h1>
<p>You made it this far: you are interested in doing better. &nbsp;Right away you may ask yourself: how can all this represent the bare minimum? &nbsp;To begin answering this question you need to embrace transformation and change. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Most importantly, if you still separate “the real world” from the “internet” world - stop. &nbsp;Just plain stop. &nbsp;It's all one world, and in many ways a flat one (Thomas Friedman's <u>The Flat World</u>, not “flat earth” and I can't believe we need to distinguish that). We have internet service on a space station and rovers on another planet effectively connecting a contact card on your phone with a computer on another planet. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, you need to understand that today's definition of security has little to do with permission, passwords, malware, and hackers. &nbsp;You - or others in your organization - are probably used to thinking making a system secure is installing a firewall or some anti-malware. &nbsp;That is so disconnected from reality you might as well quit job and sign up for the next rocket to Mars. &nbsp;Security is a balance of convenience and control in all facets of your organization. Security is concerned with all things related to the confidentiality of information, integrity of data, and the availability of systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are also a custodian of data that can cause a client, an employee, or a vendor to have - what we call - a “bad time”. &nbsp;Often, breaches mean a leak of a username or password, but they can be so much more damaging. &nbsp;Your company can lose money - lots of money - or worse, lose all of itself. Your employees can lose jobs. &nbsp;Your clients can suffer a little, or a lot. Your vendors can suffer a little, or a lot. You matter. Your company matters. &nbsp;Your cybersecurity matters.</p>
<p>Your cybersecurity is also your problem. &nbsp;While you can hire vendors to help protect systems and buy insurance to offload some of the weight, you cannot do either well unless you - the owner, the executive team, or the board - establish some form of cybersecurity strategy and do your own risk management, Good cyber security protects that ability to function, and ensures organizations can exploit the opportunities that technology brings. Cyber security is therefore central to a company's health and resilience, much like financial security, personnel security, and future security.</p>
<p>There are three common myths concerning cyber security, and having a grasp on them will help you with this journey.<br>&nbsp;</p>

        <th><strong>Myth #1:&nbsp;Cyber is complex, I won't understand it.</strong></th>
        <td>
          <p><strong>Reality:&nbsp;You don't need to be a technical expert to make an informed cyber security decision.</strong></p>
          <p>We all make security decisions every day (whether to put the alarm on, for example) without necessarily knowing how the alarm works. Boards regularly make financial or risk decisions without needing to know the details of every account or invoice. The Board should rely on its cyber&nbsp;security experts to provide&nbsp;<strong>insight</strong>,&nbsp;so that&nbsp;<strong>the Board</strong>&nbsp;can&nbsp;make informed decisions about cyber security.</p>

        <th><strong>Myth #2:&nbsp;Cyber attacks are&nbsp;sophisticated, I can't do anything to stop them.</strong></th>
        <td>
          <p><strong>Reality:&nbsp;Taking a methodical approach to cyber security and enacting relatively small changes can greatly reduce the risk to your organization.</strong></p>
          <p>The&nbsp;vast majority of attacks are still based upon well known&nbsp;techniques (such as phishing emails) which can be defended against.&nbsp;Some threats can be very sophisticated, using advanced methods to break into extremely well defended networks, but we normally only see that level of commitment and expertise in attacks by nation states.&nbsp;Most&nbsp;organisations are unlikely to be a target for a sustained effort of this type, and even those that are will find that even the most sophisticated attacker will start with the simplest and cheapest option, so as not to expose their&nbsp;advanced&nbsp;methods.</p>

      <tr>
        <th><strong>Myth #3:&nbsp;Cyber attacks are targeted,&nbsp;I'm&nbsp;not at risk.</strong></th>
        <td>
          <p><strong>Reality:&nbsp;Many cyber attacks are opportunistic and any organization could be impacted by these un-targeted attacks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
          <p>The majority of cyber attacks are un-targeted and opportunistic in nature, with the attacker&nbsp;hoping to take advantage of a weakness (or&nbsp;vulnerability) in a system, without any regard for who that system belongs to. These can&nbsp;be just as damaging as targeted attacks; the impact of&nbsp;WannaCry on global organisations - from shipping to the NHS - being a good example. If you’re connected to the internet then you are exposed to this risk. This trend of un-targeted attacks is unlikely to change because every organization - including yours - will have value to an attacker, even if that is simply the&nbsp;money you might pay&nbsp;in a ransomware attack.&nbsp;</p>

<h1>What should I be doing?</h1>
<p>Having a basic understanding of cyber security can help you to ask the right questions to seek assurance about your organization’s cyber resilience&nbsp;&nbsp;- just as you would need to have a certain level of understanding of finance to assess the financial health of your organization. A good place to begin is to discuss your existing cyber security measures with your experts and identify what constitutes 'good' cyber&nbsp;security in terms of&nbsp;assessing your organization's cyber security measures.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>BENTO:GUIDES</strong> is here to help you in three ways:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Provides a framework for cyber security.</li>
  <li>Provides guides and materials for understanding all aspects of the framework.</li>
  <li>Provides detailed recommendations for implementing your cybersecurity program.</li>
</ol>
<p>With sufficient understanding and the right relationships, you can put in place defenses that will protect your critical assets against the biggest threats. Implementing good cyber security measures is not only a key part of meeting your regulatory requirements but will also help reduce the likelihood of a significant incident. Implementing even very basic cyber security controls will help reduce the chance of an incident.&nbsp;</p>
<h1>What support can the BCSF provide on cyber security?</h1>
<p>The BCSF Team provides cyber security guidance to small companies and supports the methods for implementing information security programs. &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>understands</strong> cyber security, and summarizes this knowledge into&nbsp;practical&nbsp;guidance<strong>&nbsp;</strong>that we make available to all</li>
  <li><strong>responds </strong>to&nbsp;cyber security incidents&nbsp;to reduce the harm they cause to organisations</li>
  <li><strong>connects</strong> organizations with cyber security services providers</li>
</ul>
