## Mobile Device Guidance
> Securing mobile devices is an essential part of guarding your organisation against a variety of threats, many of which herald from the internet.
{.is-success}

### Getting Ready
> Before you start deploying and configuring mobile devices, there are a few important decisions you need to make. This includes which devices to buy, how to buy them, and how to get them into the hands of your users, securely.
> 
> The choices you make at this stage of your deployment can have a huge impact on the resulting security of your networks, so it’s important to get them right. The guides in this section will walk you through these key decisions, highlighting the security issues at stake and suggesting 'best practice' solutions where possible.

### Policies and Settings
> Once you’ve chosen which devices your staff will use and decided how they should use them, you’ll need to start thinking about how to configure these devices and the services on them. Ideally, there will be a combination of settings and controls which makes it easy for your users to get their jobs done but makes it hard for attackers to compromise your systems.
