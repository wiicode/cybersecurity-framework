# Device Management 
Device management is the process of managing the implementation, operation and maintenance of a physical and/or virtual device. It is a broad term that includes various administrative tools and processes for the maintenance and upkeep of a computing, network, mobile and/or virtual device. Majority of this section emphasizes **Mobile Device Management**, which is an industry accepted term for nearly all **End-User Devices**. While historically **worksations** and **desktops** were treated differently from phones and tables, the convergence of these technologies has made them ubquitious. BCSF assumes that all **end-user devices** are mobile devices whether they are a workstation, desktop, laptop, phone, tablet, or thin-client. 


## Mobile Device Guidance
> Securing mobile devices is an essential part of guarding your organization against a variety of threats, many of which herald from the internet.  You can also begin with our forward for [Mobile Device Guidance](/bronze-training/mobile-device-guidance).
{.is-success}

### Getting Ready
> Before you start deploying and configuring mobile devices, there are a few important decisions you need to make. This includes which devices to buy, how to buy them, and how to get them into the hands of your users, securely.
> 
> The choices you make at this stage of your deployment can have a huge impact on the resulting security of your networks, so it’s important to get them right. The guides in this section will walk you through these key decisions, highlighting the security issues at stake and suggesting 'best practice' solutions where possible.

### Policies and Settings
> Once you’ve chosen which devices your staff will use and decided how they should use them, you’ll need to start thinking about how to configure these devices and the services on them. Ideally, there will be a combination of settings and controls which makes it easy for your users to get their jobs done but makes it hard for attackers to compromise your systems.
