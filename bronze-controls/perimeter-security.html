<p>All organizations should ensure that unfettered access to the internet is not possible. &nbsp;When it comes to securing internet traffic, Bento Cyber Security Framework focuses primarily on <strong>detection and mitigation of malicious content</strong>. &nbsp;This strategy focuses on a small subset of risky vectors such as malicious websites, malicious downloads, and specific forms of traffic rather than attempt to control internet access as a whole. Despite the relatively narrow focus, the magnitude of effort in this area is large and can consume large chunks of IT/IS budgets. Considerations for this strategy include:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Whether the organization <strong>owns perimeter hardware capable </strong>of managing traffic and <strong>can handle the work-load </strong>effectively. &nbsp;The second point is as important as the first, many appliances cannot scan traffic effectively unless they are sized up many times over. &nbsp;It's extremely difficult for boards/managers to understand the necessity to spend exponentially more than expected.</li>
  <li>How the organization decides what is necessary and/or allowed. In most small environments internet is fairly open.</li>
  <li>How users are protected when they are not in the office (at home, traveling, or on mobile).</li>
  <li>Understand the scope of devices being protected and how filtration technologies can affect all the devices which attempt to connect to the internet (https://www.nist.gov/itl/smallbusinesscyber/securing-data-devices).</li>
  <li>Whether existing management technologies permit deployment of security tools effectively.</li>
  <li>Whether the organization is capable of enforcing user-choice restrictions for internet browsers.</li>
  <li>Whether or not the browsers used are managed through enterprise-grade management technologies.</li>
</ol>
<p>The overall assessment, inventory, and understanding of these pieces is daunting, and the outcomes are not always clear. &nbsp;Therefore, BCSF recommends taking an approach where early detection and prevention of malicious content is the focus as this process has far more clear options and is less costly than the alternative. &nbsp;To be successful, most smaller organizations are better off breaking this area into smaller - manageable - problems and addressing them in context of the overall strategy than attempt to implement a comprehensive solution. Another term commonly used for this strategy is “layered defense”. &nbsp;</p>
<p>While it is possible to block certain content from employee use, the inverse is not a practical or feasible approach. &nbsp;Organizations attempting ad-hock content filtration typically enter cycles of blocking and unblocking until a failure causing the entire system to be disabled. &nbsp; This is because most content sources leverage Content-Delivery-Networks and use major providers such as Amazon, CloudFlare, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud to supply content. The internet is a dynamic system and such attempts are often valueless and disruptive. Blocking all traffic - effectively and with assurance - requires extraordinary investment in filtration resources. For organizations in need of completely controlling web access on a granular scale for on-premise and remote workers, BCSF refers to NIST SP 800-46 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-46r2.pdf). &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Components of a secure internet system</h2>
<p>There are effective and affordable ways to reduce your <i>organization</i>’s exposure to the more common types of cyber attack on systems that are exposed to the Internet. The following subset of controls applied specifically to this approach:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>boundary firewalls and internet gateways</strong> —&nbsp;establish network perimeter <i>defenses</i>, particularly web proxy, web filtering, content checking, and firewall policies to detect and block executable downloads, block access to known malicious domains and prevent users’ computers from communicating directly with the Internet</li>
  <li><strong>secure configuration</strong> —&nbsp;restrict the functionality of every device, operating system and application to the minimum needed for business to function</li>
  <li><strong>malware protection</strong> —&nbsp;establish and maintain malware<i> defenses </i>to detect and respond to known attack code</li>
  <li><strong>patch management</strong> —&nbsp;patch known vulnerabilities with the latest version of the software, to prevent attacks which exploit software bugs</li>
  <li><strong>user access control</strong> —&nbsp;include limiting normal users’ execution permissions and enforcing the principle of least privilege</li>
</ul>
<p>If your<i> organization </i>is likely to be targeted by a more technically capable attacker, give yourself greater confidence with additional focus on:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>security monitoring</strong> —&nbsp;to identify any unexpected or suspicious activity</li>
  <li><strong>user training education and awareness</strong> —&nbsp;staff should understand their role in keeping your<i> organization </i>secure and report any unusual activity</li>
  <li><strong>security incident management</strong> —&nbsp;put plans in place to deal with an attack as an effective response will reduce the impact on your business</li>
</ul>
