<p>We recommend a phased approach to securing your email:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Choose an anti-spoofing management tool</li>
  <li>Protect email in transit</li>
  <li>Configure anti-spoofing controls</li>
  <li>Send spoof emails to spam</li>
  <li>Spoof emails being rejected</li>
  <li>Continuous improvement</li>
</ol>
<p>The size and complexity of your <i>organisation</i>, the amount of change occurring and resources available to you will determine exactly how long you need.</p>
<p>Once you have secured your emails in transit, and implemented a DMARC policy of '<i>reject'</i> on all of your domains, you should regularly conduct health checks and fix any problems which show up.</p>
<p>You should create a basic plan for your implementation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
