<p>At this point you should have identified and resolved any issues arising during the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/email-security-and-anti-spoofing/mark-spoof-emails-as-spam">“quarantine phase”</a>. As soon as you are confident DKIM and SPF are continuing to work correctly, you should move to a DMARC policy of&nbsp;<i>‘reject’</i>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having a DMARC policy of ‘<i>reject</i>’ on all of your domains is the best way to prevent spoofing of your&nbsp;email. The goal for this section is to help you get to that point.</p>
<p>Many organisations report being able to move on from a DMARC policy of ‘<i>quarantine</i>’ to one of&nbsp;<i>'reject'&nbsp;</i>after about 3 months.</p>

<h2>Iterating a DMARC record</h2>
<p>At this point, you should be confident that you have an accurate&nbsp;SPF&nbsp;record and are&nbsp;DKIM&nbsp;signing outbound messages. You should also have identified that all legitimate email is passing freely, while illegitimate email is being quarantined.</p>
<p>We recommend you now update your&nbsp;DMARC record&nbsp;to a policy of&nbsp;<i>p=reject</i>&nbsp;and apply it to a small percentage of your email.</p>
<p>Implementing a policy of&nbsp;<i>p=reject</i>&nbsp;will instruct recipients to reject any of the email sample that doesn't pass DMARC checks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting with a small percentage will help ensure any mistakes don’t affect all email delivery. Gradually increase the percentage to 100 as you confirm&nbsp;genuine email&nbsp;is being delivered, using the DMARC processing tool chosen in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/email-security-and-anti-spoofing/choose-anti-spoofing-management-tool">Step 1</a>.</p>
<p><strong>An example record applied to 50% of your email looks like this:</strong></p>
<p><code>v=DMARC1;p=reject;sp=reject;fo=1;pct=50;rua=mailto:dmarc@yourdomain.gov.uk</code></p>
<h3><strong>Reject and quarantine</strong></h3>
<p>If you have <i>pct=50</i> in your <i>reject</i> record, a policy of&nbsp;<i>quarantine</i>&nbsp;will be applied to all remaining email.&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<h2>Keep everyone informed</h2>
<p>Notify your <i>organisation</i>’s management team of your implementation plan and ask that they alert you to any planned peak email traffic flows (for example, mass mailings).</p>
<p>If you experience any problems, you can revert to the DMARC policy of&nbsp;<i>p=quarantine</i>&nbsp;until you are ready to progress again.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Closely monitor and update your records</h2>
<p>After updating your DNS records with a DMARC policy of 'reject', we recommend that you closely monitor your reports for at least a 2 week period.</p>
<p>As 'reject' is the final DMARC policy to implement, we recommend that you continue to monitor your controls, as detailed in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/email-security-and-anti-spoofing/continuous-improvement">Continuous Improvement.</a></p>
