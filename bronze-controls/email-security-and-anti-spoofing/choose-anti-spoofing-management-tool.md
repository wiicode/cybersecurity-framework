Implementing controls to secure your domains and emails in transit can generate a lot of data. There are a number of [open source and commercial tools available](https://dmarc.org/resources/products-and-services/) which will help you make sense of this data.

Most of these tools will provide you with information as to whether your DMARC, SPF, DKIM and TLS configurations are correct.

If errors are detected, they often give advice on how to correct the configurations. We recommend you use one of these tools to assess your email security and anti-spoofing measures.
