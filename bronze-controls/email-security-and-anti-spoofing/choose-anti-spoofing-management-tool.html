<p>Implementing controls to secure your domains and emails in transit can generate a lot of data. There are a number of&nbsp;<a href="https://dmarc.org/resources/products-and-services/">open source and commercial tools available</a>&nbsp;which will help you make sense of this data.</p>
<p>Most of these tools will provide you with information as to whether your DMARC, SPF, DKIM and TLS configurations are correct.</p>
<p>If errors are detected, they often give advice on how to correct the configurations. We recommend you use one of these tools to assess your email security and anti-spoofing measures.</p>
<p>If you are a public sector body, or an operator of&nbsp;Critical<i> National </i>Infrastructure (CNI) you may be able to sign up for the <i>NCSC</i>'s Mail Check service</p>
