<p>At BCSF we often speak in terms of policy statements that originate from management and then are applied through practices and procedures; most importantly, they are there to fit your organizational business practices. &nbsp;When it comes to securing third-party e-mail forms and systems the implementation of BCSF's policy statement is not optional because many systems have already made systemic changes to force compliance. &nbsp;However, other systems - like your organization's website - may not have adapted and thus it is critical to understand and act as your organization be open to abuse or miss important e-mail communications.</p>
<h1>Understanding how e-mail through third-parties may flow.&nbsp;</h1>

<h1>Third-party email in real world practice.&nbsp;</h1>
<h2>Website Feedback Forms</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Support Systems and Automatic Replies</h2>
<p>Your support systems are also affected by e-mail protections. &nbsp;For example, if you use ZenDesk, you may have already realized that they implemented a programming change that prevented certain variables from working on the very first e-mail to avoid abuse. This affected all new tickets as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>When a new ticket is created, it is not possible to include the body of the request in the confirmation message</li>
  <li>When a new ticket is created, the subject of the message is not honored and the only option is to send a generic subjects such as “Request Received.”</li>
</ul>
