<p>Major mail systems today, such as Exchange Online or Gmail, enforce a number of controls designed to thwart the spread of ransomware, reduce the chances of identity theft, minimize spear phishing, block malicious links, and filter out spam. Even in the most basic form, these systems can work against your organization's interest when it comes to collecting feedback / forms data from your digital marketing assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before getting started, BCSF encourages to take stock of your feedback systems through the assessment below. &nbsp;Each statement represents a key component of an organization-wide implementation of feedback forms. In the least, a high number of “No” and “N/A” responses is indicative of problematic feedback form strategy.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Website Feedback Forms</h2>

<h2>Support Systems and Automatic Replies</h2>
<p>Your support systems are also affected by e-mail protections. &nbsp;For example, if you use ZenDesk, you may have already realized that they implemented a programming change that prevented certain variables from working on the very first e-mail to avoid abuse. This affected all new tickets as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>When a new ticket is created, it is not possible to include the body of the request in the confirmation message</li>
  <li>When a new ticket is created, the subject of the message is not honored and the only option is to send a generic subjects such as “Request Received.”</li>
</ul>
