<p>Major mail systems today, such as Exchange Online or Gmail, enforce a number of controls designed to thwart the spread of ransomware, reduce the chances of identity theft, minimize spear phishing, block malicious links, and filter out spam. Even in the most basic form, these systems can work against your organization's interest when it comes to collecting feedback / forms data from your digital marketing assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to securing third-party e-mail forms and systems the implementation of BCSF's policy statement is not optional because many systems have already made systemic changes to force compliance. &nbsp;However, other systems - like your organization's website - may not have adapted and thus it is critical to understand and act as your organization be open to abuse or miss important e-mail communications.</p>

<h2>Website Feedback Forms</h2>

<h2>Support Systems and Automatic Replies</h2>
<p>Your support systems are also affected by e-mail protections. &nbsp;For example, if you use ZenDesk, you may have already realized that they implemented a programming change that prevented certain variables from working on the very first e-mail to avoid abuse. This affected all new tickets as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>When a new ticket is created, it is not possible to include the body of the request in the confirmation message</li>
  <li>When a new ticket is created, the subject of the message is not honored and the only option is to send a generic subjects such as “Request Received.”</li>
</ul>
