<p>Major mail systems today, such as Exchange Online or Gmail, enforce a number of controls designed to thwart the spread of ransomware, reduce the chances of identity theft, minimize spear phishing, block malicious links, and filter out spam. Even in the most basic form, these systems can work against your organization's interest when it comes to collecting feedback / forms data from your digital marketing assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Feedback form transport is surprisingly complex because of the<strong> protection measures</strong> as well as the <strong>custodial responsibility</strong> of your organization over the data that may be submitted. &nbsp;The general strategy for any organization should be to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Collect data that is material to objectives.</li>
  <li>Transport all data securely and protect the confidentiality of the information on arrival.</li>
  <li>Put organizational security (including MFA, Identity, and Conditional Access) ahead of feedback form concerns.</li>
  <li>Be able to audit every message transported and its delivery easily so that it is routine.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Review your posture.&nbsp;</h1>
<p>Before getting started, BCSF encourages to take stock of your feedback systems through the assessment below. &nbsp;Each statement represents a key component of an organization-wide implementation of feedback forms. In the least, a high number of “No” and “N/A” responses is indicative of problematic feedback form strategy.&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Understanding how e-mail through third-parties may flow.&nbsp;</h1>
<figure class="image image-style-align-right"><img src="/article_images/mailflow-diagram-webforms.png">
  <figcaption>Email Webform Flow Diagram</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Most organizations today rely on Exchange or Google Workspace (or similar mail systems) to handle organizational email. &nbsp;These systems offer standard mail filtration in the basic plans, encourage adoption of DMARC/DKIM/SPF to ensure trust in email, encourage use of MFA to restrict mailbox access, and finally offer advanced tiers of security solutions for additional threat protections. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Web forms sending to these organizations must contend and adapt to all of those things to successfully deliver messages. &nbsp;While a contact form may seem simple, the lifecycle of the data inside the form - today - follows this general trend when designed correctly:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Feedback form securely accepts requestor data and builds the message.</li>
  <li>Messages are sent with full SPF compliance to the target recipients.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Mail system receiving the message scans the message for threats and delivers the message to the target user or group.</li>
</ul>
<figure class="image image-style-align-right"><img src="/article_images/dkim-envelope-1.png"></figure>
<p>Each of these milestones has a series of much smaller, and much more important, steps and decision points. &nbsp;Collectively, their job is to ensure that the purported sender of the message is the person whose email address is in the <strong>FROM</strong> field of the message. &nbsp;Let's put that into an analogy we all may understand better.</p>
<figure class="image image-style-align-right"><img src="/article_images/dkim-letter-2.png"></figure>
<p>Suppose you have a letter mailed to you in an envelope from “B. Baz”. &nbsp;If it is an analog envelope and letter, you put some amount of trust that Baz did send the letter, but you also have a few things you can do to try to validate it. For instance, you can look at the cancelled stamp and make a decision as to whether or not the post office the letter moved through makes sense for the letter. &nbsp;If you use a service called “Informed Delivery” you could verify the message went through the Post Office and was not just shoved into your mailbox. &nbsp;If the letter was important, actions on behalf of the sender could have been implemented to help underscore the importance &nbsp;- such as registered mail, priority, and certified. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Mail systems that leverage filters, SPF, DMARC, and DKIM do all these extra checks to attempt to verify that sender, the message transport services, and the recipient are all valid. &nbsp;If we continue along this analog mail analogy one could say that these systems:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Attempt to verify the sender on the envelope matches the signature in the message.</li>
  <li>Attempt to verify that the sender's address is real.</li>
  <li>Attempt to verify the recipient address is real.</li>
  <li>Attempt to verify that the content of the message is consistent with intent.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, advanced threat protection will often</p>
<ul>
  <li>Read the email and assess if the subject matter is applicable to business.</li>
  <li>Review relationships of the sender to recipient and attempt to determine if there is ample history or cause for the message to be routed.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Third-party email in real world practice.&nbsp;</h1>
<h2>Website Feedback Forms</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Support Systems and Automatic Replies</h2>
<p>Your support systems are also affected by e-mail protections. &nbsp;For example, if you use ZenDesk, you may have already realized that they implemented a programming change that prevented certain variables from working on the very first e-mail to avoid abuse. This affected all new tickets as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>When a new ticket is created, it is not possible to include the body of the request in the confirmation message</li>
  <li>When a new ticket is created, the subject of the message is not honored and the only option is to send a generic subjects such as “Request Received.”</li>
</ul>
