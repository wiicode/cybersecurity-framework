<p>Software as a Service (SaaS) applications are&nbsp;increasingly&nbsp;popular. Many of&nbsp;us use them&nbsp;on a daily basis, so it's important we know how to check if they are&nbsp;suitably&nbsp;secure.</p>
<p>To do this, the<i> NCSC </i>have developed a set of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/saas-security?curPage=/collection/saas-security/saas-security-principles">SaaS security principles</a>, derived from a&nbsp;slimmed down subset of&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/cloud-security"><i>NCSC</i>'s cloud security principles</a>. These SaaS security principles represent our&nbsp;judgement as to the minimum set of security attributes you should seek to understand before using a SaaS offering.</p>
<p>We have used the SaaS security principles to assess&nbsp;the security properties of a range of popular SaaS offerings. You can find these in the&nbsp;security reviews&nbsp;section below.&nbsp;You should read these as worked examples, demonstrating how the principles can be used to evaluate the suitability of&nbsp;any&nbsp;service you are interested in. Given that these services evolve over time, we recommend that you re-test your choice of service periodically.</p>
<p>As our approach provides a&nbsp;minimum&nbsp;level of confidence,&nbsp;your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/risk-management-collection">risk management processes</a>&nbsp;might determine that your requirements are more exacting. This will be particularly true for workloads which you deem sensitive, or are covered by other regulations (such as&nbsp;PCI, DSS or GDPR).&nbsp;</p>
