Containment strategies vary based on the **type of incident**. For example, the strategy for containing an email-borne malware infection is quite different from that of a network-based DDoS attack. Organizations should create separate containment strategies for each major incident type, with criteria documented clearly to facilitate decision-making. Criteria for determining the appropriate strategy include:

- Potential damage to and theft of resources
- Need for evidence preservation
- Service availability (e.g., network connectivity, services provided to external parties)
- Time and resources needed to implement the strategy
- Effectiveness of the strategy (e.g., partial containment, full containment)
- Duration of the solution (e.g., emergency workaround to be removed in four hours, temporary workaround to be removed in two weeks, permanent solution).

# Why is incident classification important?

There are several reasons, main ones are:

- categorization directly helps improve incident management;
- it also helps event/incident long-term analysis;
- it supports incident information exchange;
- categorization helps automate event/incident reporting and response.

> According to US ISO/IEC 27035, security incidents may result from deliberate or accidental actions of humans through technical or physical means. The Standard presents incident categories below and their ranking at Organization as they are viewed today.

# Tabs {.tabset}
## Category

Natural disaster incident 

## Explanation

The loss of information security is caused by natural disasters beyond human control. 

## Example

Pandemic, earthquake, volcano, flood, violent wind, lightning, tsunami, collapse, etc. 

## Application

For remote workers, you need to analyze which kinds of incidents can happen to the data stored on their computers and communicated over the Internet. Once you know this, only then can you decide whether your employees will be required to use VPN, complex passwords, encrypt data, use only pre-approved cloud services, regularly back up the data, etc. 

# Tabs {.tabset}
## Category

Social Unrest

## Explanation

The loss of information security is caused by the instability of society. 

## Example

Bedin, terrorist assault, war, etc. 

# Tabs {.tabset}
## Category

Physical Damage

## Explanation

The loss of information security is caused by deliberately or accidentally physical actions. 

## Example

Fire, water, electrostatic, abominable environment (such as pollution, dust, corrosion, freezing), destruction of equipment, destruction of media, theft of equipment, theft of media, loss of equipment, loss of media, tampering with equipment, tampering with media, etc. 

# Tabs {.tabset}
## Category

Infrastructure Failure

## Explanation

The loss of information security is caused by the failures of the basic systems and services that support the running of information systems. 

## Example

Power-supply failure, networking failure, air-conditioning failure, water-supply failure, etc.

# Tabs {.tabset}
## Category

Radiation disturbance

## Explanation

The loss of information security is caused by the disturbance due to radiation. 

## Example

Electromagnetic radiation, electromagnetic pulse, electronic jamming, voltage fluctuation, thermal radiation, etc. 

# Tabs {.tabset}
## Category

Technical Failure

## Explanation

The loss of information security is caused by the faults in information systems or related non-technical facilities, as well as unintentional man-made problems, resulting in information systems unavailability or destruction. 

## Example

Hardware failure, software malfunction, overloading (saturating the capacity of information systems), breach of maintainability, etc. 

# Tabs {.tabset}
## Category

Malware Incident

## Explanation

The loss of information security is caused by malicious programs that are created and disseminated deliberately. A malicious program is inserted into information systems to damage the confidentiality, integrity or availability of data, applications or operating systems, and/or affect the normal operation of information systems. 

## Example

Computer virus, network worm, Trojan horse, botnet, blended attacks, malicious code embedded web page, malicious code hosting site, etc

# Tabs {.tabset}
## Category

Technical Attack Incident

## Explanation

The loss of information security is caused by attacking information systems through networks or other technical means, either by exploiting information systems' vulnerabilities in configurations, protocols or programs, or by force, which results in an abnormal status of information systems, or potential harm to the current system operations. 

## Example

Network scanning, exploitation of vulnerability, exploitation of backdoor, login attempts, interference, DoS, etc. 

# Tabs {.tabset}
## Category

Breach of Rule Incident

## Explanation

The loss of information security is caused by breaching rules deliberately or accidentally.

## Example

Unauthorized use of resources, breach of copyright, etc. 

# Tabs {.tabset}
## Category

Compromise of functions.

## Explanation

The loss of information security is caused by deliberately or accidentally compromising the functions of information systems in terms of security

## Example

Abuse of rights, forging of rights, denial of actions, mis-operations, breach of personnel availability, etc.

# Tabs {.tabset}
## Category

Compromise of information.

## Explanation

The loss of information security is caused by deliberately or accidentally compromising the security of information such as confidentiality, integrity, availability and etc. 

## Example

Interception, spying, eavesdropping, disclosure, masquerade, social engineering, network phishing, theft of data, loss of data, tampering with data, data error, data flow analysis, position detection, etc

# Tabs {.tabset}
## Category
Harmful content.

## Explanation
The loss of information security is caused by propagating undesirable content through information networks, which endangers national security, social stability and/or public safety and benefits. 

## Example
Illegal content, panic content, malicious content, abusive content, etc.
