<h1>Windows 10</h1>
<p>Security guidance for organisations on the secure configuration of Windows 10.</p>
<p>Whilst this guide does not apply to any specific version of Windows, it was last tested on Windows 10 2004 Enterprise Edition, which has more features available than some <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/windowsforbusiness/compare">other versions of Windows 10</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Securing Windows 10</h2>
<p>There are a number of configuration options which you can use to secure this platform within your organisation. However, we specifically recommend you implement technical and procedural controls relating to the following areas.</p>
<h3>General recommendations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Decide which Windows 10 devices your organisation will use:</li>
  <li>Devices with hardware requirements to enable features such as Virtualization-Based Security and full disk encryption are preferred.</li>
  <li>Windows 10 devices typically receive software updates multiple times a year, with major updates twice a year. We recommend keeping devices as up to date as your organisation allows. Microsoft's <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/13853/windows-lifecycle-fact-sheet">Windows lifecycle fact sheet</a> can help you plan upgrades to keep your organisation using supported versions.</li>
  <li>Use one of the recommended network architectures to enable remote access to enterprise services.</li>
  <li>Use a Mobile Device Management service to configure, monitor and enforce technical controls on your Windows 10 devices. Enable any logging and monitoring features.</li>
  <li>If you are moving from on-premises only to include cloud, a hybrid network deployment is recommended initially. This can be done using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/whatis-azure-ad-connect">Azure Connect</a>. Some <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/design-a-hybrid-network-architecture/">help on hybrid architecture</a> can be found on the Microsoft website.</li>
  <li>Use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/windows-autopilot/windows-autopilot">Windows Autopilot</a> to enrol and provision devices via zero touch enrolment with a trusted Windows 10 base image. Provision non-administrative accounts during setup, removing the need for local admin accounts.</li>
  <li>Configure <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/comprehensive-security">Windows Defender</a> to help protect against malicious software.If you wish to use a 3rd party Antivirus, weâ€™d recommend one that uses <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-antivirus/utilize-microsoft-cloud-protection-microsoft-defender-antivirus">cloud detection</a> and hooks into the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/amsi/antimalware-scan-interface-portal">Anti-Malware Scan Interface (AMSI)</a>.</li>
  <li>Cameras are enabled to allow for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/hello-overview">Windows Hello</a> and video conferencing. However, this may not be appropriate for your specific deployment environment - in which case these features should be disabled.</li>
  <li>Disable Microsoft Office macros, if this is not possible then only allow macros for specific apps or users where absolutely required. See macro security for Microsoft Office for further guidance.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Device configuration</h3>
<p>Once you have chosen your MDM service, architecture and approach to applications, you should then develop a device configuration profile, which can be used to enforce your technical controls.</p>
<p>You should include policies which cover the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The use of biometrics, as well as passcodes and authentication using Windows Hello for Business.</li>
  <li>For devices without a TPM, we advise using a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/enterprise/hybrid-modern-auth-overview#what-is-modern-authentication">modern authentication standard</a>.</li>
  <li>Configuration of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/bitlocker/bitlocker-overview">BitLocker encryption</a> settings to prevent data extraction using physical attacks. Using a TPM with PIN and Full Disk Encryption is recommended.</li>
  <li>External interface protection, including wired and wireless peripherals. Use Direct Memory Access protections, such as ensuring new Direct Memory Access capable devices cannot be enumerated when the device is locked.</li>
  <li>Automatic updates to your operating system and applications, along with firmware and drivers where applicable. We recommend configuring <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/update/waas-configure-wufb">Windows Update for Business</a> to enable this.</li>
  <li>The built-in Always on, IKEv2 virtual private network (VPN) (if a VPN is required), along with the use of hardware-backed storage for VPN credentials, through Windows Hello for Business, or the use of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/component-updates/tpm-key-attestation">Windows Key Attestation</a>.</li>
  <li>We recommend configuring the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/vpn/vpn-connection-type">Windows 10 Built-In VPN Client</a> configured as per customisation guide, available for public sector organisations by contacting NCSC enquiries (this archive also includes the NCSC Captive Portal Helper app for always-on VPNs).</li>
  <li>If using a 3rd party VPN, configure in line with the NCSC's IPsec Guidance or TLS Guidance and following our platform independent guidance on VPNs.</li>
  <li>AppLocker to help defend against malware and ransomware - a recommended sample configuration is provided in the configuration pack. Additionally, you should include policies that manage third-party apps for work use from an enterprise app catalogue, delivered via MDM, through a private store.</li>
  <li>The security of Cloud accounts on users' devices, by using conditional access to control access to the sensitive features and services that are required by your organisation.</li>
  <li>Removal of Internet Explorer. However, if you want to utilise Windows Defender Application Guard, Internet Explorer is a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-guard/reqs-wd-app-guard">requirement</a>.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Configuration of Windows Defender Firewall to help reduce unwanted connections on Private/Public networks. By default, block outbound traffic on these networks, adding rules to allow specific exceptions for the services and protocols your organisation requires.</li>
</ul>
