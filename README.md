# Bento Cyber Security Framework & Guides

I began work on Bento Cyber Security Framework & Guides sometime in 2020. At the time this was purely a documentation project designed to expand control design documentation.  This was a collection of knowledge, brain dump, and philosophies.  All of it was designed with small business in mind: a box of answers to many questions.  Today, it's here for me and for those of you who are looking to do more with information security management.
