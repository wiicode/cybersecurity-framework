# Learning and Training

> Deloitte estimates that some common criminal businesses can be operated for as little as $34 month and could return $25,000, while others may routinely require nearly $3,800 a month and could return up to $1 million per month.

> All businesses use information. If that information is compromised in some way, the business may not be able to function. Protecting the information an organization creates, uses, or stores is information security. Information security concentrates on how to protect confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all business information; this is known as the CIA triad.
{.is-info}

The CIA triad is a model designed to guide policies for information security within an organization. **Confidentiality** is protecting information from unauthorized access and disclosure. **Integrity** is protecting information from unauthorized modification. **Availability** is preventing disruption in how an organization accesses the data.

# A Note about Humans
> Humans are the primary vulnerability in majority of the scams and hacks that affect today’s small business. It is important to understand that, despite the plethora of vulnerabilities and exploits available to attackers, the ones that are low-effort and high-reward are the greatest threat to a business. Passwords, attachments, and links are the lowest-effort means of exploitation, and all are at full control and discretion of the people working for the organization. Whether it is through human error or willful acts, humans factors are the of greatest concern in cybersecurity.
{.is-info}

Cyber security researchers can generally find 359 ways to compromise your systems, but not all will work for your business.  BCSF encourages companies delop their own materials rather than outousrce that responsibility to tools and subscriptions.  With that said, a subscription may be part of your program, but it should not be the whole process.  A successful program often includes:

- Policies and Procedures training during onboarding and annually.
- Regular team meetings where cyber security is given 1-5 minutes.
- Case studies and stories of compromise for review.
- Security Awareness testing. 
- Insider threat detection. 

## People's Attitudes

There are also five hazardous attitudes which contribute to the general vulnerabilities staff, managers, and owners. Like most things in security, or even human nature, they are not binary and exist on spectrums. All present a threat an organization and they are: impulsivity, invulnerability, machismo, resignation, and anti-authority.

### Tabs {.tabset}
#### Impulsivity

Impulsivity is attributed to heavy workloads and due to the general demand competitive work environments. Often, staff are attempting to get work done quickly. In the flurry of activity they can easily can mis-click, misread, or misinterpret an obvious threat or dismiss it after it had been triggered.

#### Invulnerability

Invulnerability is mostly associated with managers, or owners, and represents the false assumption that they are too small, too insignificant, or too simple to be a targeted. Such individuals often have fast, or direct, responses to security concerns and have taken basic measures to protect systems. The incomplete understanding of the cybersecurity landscape leads to profound gaps in the security process for the organization and general shortsightedness.

#### Machismo

Machismo is a compliment to invulnerability and also is a quality of managers and owners. Generally, it is associated with lack of sufficient understanding of security and threat management technologies, and thus fail to see the inadequacies of such controls. Suggesting that the mere presence of a firewall is sufficient to protect a system is an example.

#### Resignation

Resignation can vary with roles and is the effective surrender to threats. For managers, resignation is choosing not to do the work necessary to prevent incidents or transferring the responsibility for dealing with an incident to someone else instead of managing it. For staff, it is failing to learn safe computing practices, take training seriously, or act thoughtfully when faced with an incident.

#### Anti-authority

Anti-authority is a non-conformist approach to cybersecurity. Despite being connected to the same internet, using similar hardware, working with the same software as most organizations around the world, anti-authoritarian managers and owners chose to avoid the work, fail to comply with standards, ignore education opportunities. Such individuals continue to conduct business as they always have and have not yet come to terms that the current cybersecurity needs.
Traits.

## Responses to Attitudes
> Technology cannot fix culture or human error, at best it can help to mitigate it. Successful cybersecurity comes from within the individuals that work for your organization, and their relationship with you and your data security team. Research has shown, however, that there are key qualities beneficial to minimizing security risks and include: integrity, depth of knowledge, compliance, questioning attitude, and formality in communication. The people doing the work carrying your business forward are the best line of defense. As much as staff need awareness training, education, standards, policies, guidelines, and procedures they become exponentially more valuable to cybersecurity when they have a developed these traits.
{.is-success}

### Tabs {.tabset}

#### Curiousity

A questioning attitude is likely the most difficult trait to develop, but it is also the one that carries the greatest benefit. If people  listen to their internal alarm bells, search for the causes, and then take corrective action, the chances that they’ll forestall problems rise dramatically.

#### Integrity

Integrity is the deeply internalized ideal that leads people, without exception, to eliminate “sins of commission” (deliberate departures from protocol) and own up immediately to mistakes. Integrity is dependent on a culture that rewards honesty and offers consequences for lack thereof.

#### Education

Depth of knowledge is the result of proper education. Staff with thoroughly understand all aspects of a system—including the way it’s engineered, its vulnerabilities, and the procedures required to operate it—more readily recognize when something is wrong and handle any anomaly more effectively.

#### Methodolgy 

Procedural compliance is about knowing—or knowing where to find—proper operational procedures and to follow them to the letter. They’re also expected to recognize when a situation has eclipsed existing written procedures and new ones are called for.

#### Mindfulness

Having good judgement is a quality that any hiring manager ought to demand.  Wether your job is spent refilling vending machines or sending rockets to Mars, there is no substitue for making good choices in the moment. Encouraging mindfulness in every team is essential to cyber securiity.
